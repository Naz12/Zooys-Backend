A lot [ __ ]\nhappened.\n>> I know.\n>> I wanted to call in.\n>> It was so much going on. So much\nhappened. But but listen, did you know\n>> that game interview was viral over\nthere?\n>> Really? I mean that's I mean come on,\nit's the internet that's everywhere.\n>> Yeah, but like Australia is just so\nremoved from everything.\n>> Really?\n>> Yeah. It's just like I' never been.\n>> They tap in like they're great. It was\nawesome. And but like they're removed,\nbro.\n>> Yeah. You're on an island in the middle\nof the ocean.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And just surrounded by Asian.\n>> A lot of Iggies over there.\n>> Yeah. What\n>> is there a lot of Iggies over there or\nis like she like a\n>> No, she's not an anomaly. Like they're\nin shape. They're in shape over there.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're in shape.\n>> So, Dr. Uma would like maybe do a little\nlittle second take a few.\n>> I think he might have to. I think he\nmight. And technically they're Asian.\nThey're not white, so he might be able\nto slide through. Yeah.\n>> So, Iggy is Asian.\n>> Well, I think Where is Australia?\n>> Asia.\n>> It's an Asia. Yeah, they're Asian.\n>> That could be Yo, Iggy is your rebrand.\nCome out as Rice Spice and freaking You\nknow what I'm saying? I'm serious. She\ncould rebrand and come back. I think I\nthink that is the move.\n>> That would be fire. Like yo, she really\ntapping her Australian Asian roots. My\nname is Rice Spice now and he is dead.\nKnow what I'm saying? She could kill. So\nwhere did y'all shoot? Cuz that's what\nwe was wondering. We looking like, yo,\nthey always at the amusement park,\n>> bro. 50's back here,\n>> bro. 50 is\n>> Oh yeah. So people pop in and out,\nright? Like so if you know depending on\nlike how much you're in the movie and\nlike what parts of the movie you're in,\nyou got to stay for shorter or longer.\nSo like they were able to and you got\nall these different people in it that\nhave like really restricted schedules.\nSo like you know 50 stuff. I think he\nwas there for like a month. He lost like\n25 pounds.\n>> I saw.\n>> Bro, it was it was crazy. And he's just\n50. You want to hear a fun 50 story?\n>> There's no such thing as a not fun 50\nstory.\n>> All right. We're at the first cast\ndinner, right? So he comes in, right? 50\nis like a he's, you know, he's a major\ncharacter in the movie, but it's not\nlike the biggest part of the movie.\n>> He plays what? Brog, right? Which is\nlike iconic character. Like that was\nmade after Mike Tyson. Here's some\nlittle Street Fighter lore. The bad guy\nin in Street Fighter is called Mbison.\n>> Yep.\n>> Right.\n>> Hilarious.\n>> So they made Ballrog in the real version\nin like Japan.\nBallrog's name is Mbison, right? And\nthen somebody told the Japanese creators\nlike, \"Yo, you can't just make a guy\nthat's\n>> right\n>> like Mike Tyson who has boxing club and\ncall Bison. They're going to know.\" So\nthey just switch the character names.\n>> Hilarious. So, Ball Ro. So, they call\nhim Ballrog, whatever. And uh he walks\nin to the party and everybody's excited\nto see 50, right? Like a lot of these\nlike actors they never met. He walks in\nand he goes, \"Hey, man. I just want to\nthank you guys all so much for being a\npart of my movie, man.\" And\nso, he's called in court at dinner and\nhe goes like pick up a champagne glass.\nThere's not even champagne in it. And he\nlike spills it a little bit on me,\nright? And he goes, \"Dude, I'm so sorry,\nbro. Here.\" And he takes off his Rolex.\n>> Get the [ __ ] out of here.\n>> And he goes, \"Here, so just take that,\nman. I'm so sorry.\" I go,\n>> \"Get the [ __ ] out of here.\n>> I'm not taking his Rolex.\" He goes, \"No,\nbro. I feel horrible.\" And I was like,\n\"There's no way you feel that bad,\nright?\"\n>> And he's like, he's like, \"No,\nseriously, you got to take it.\" I'm\nlike, \"I'm not going to take it.\" He\ngoes, \"If your wife was here, she would\ntake it.\" She would take it, but she's\nnot at this dinner. And uh I go, \"I'm\nnot going to take that.\" And he goes,\n\"You sure?\" Yeah, because I know that\nlater three guys would break into my\napartment and take this back and I don't\nwant to put my family through that.\n>> Run it back by Monday.\n>> And 50 is like, \"Nah, bro. I couldn't\nget my guys with the felonies in the\ncountry, right?\"\n>> Why didn't they just get Mike Tyson to\nplay ball? I'm glad 50 is, but but why\ncouldn't Mike? He's not\n>> maybe too on the nose, you know? Like\nyou also like want somebody with some,\nyou know, acting shops experience. I\nalso think like if you see Mike Tyson in\nanything, you can't Mike Tyson.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, so it's like\n>> especially with the gloves and\neverything, it'll be like, \"Yeah, who\nwho the [ __ ] is Ball?\"\n>> Also, 5050 like it's his movie.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know what I mean? Like\n>> he said he said they're doing a spin-off\nwith just him\n>> that he like day one he's already\ntelling people what's it's amazing. He's\njust a force on set\n>> and it's going to happen.\n>> He will he will [ __ ] into existence.\n>> It's going to happen. Is the movie going\nto be good though? Yo, bro. This movie\nis going to, and I'm not saying this on\nsome actor [ __ ] Everything is made in\nthe edit, so I can't control the edit.\n>> But what I will say is\n>> you are going to go see if the edit\nmatches like what we were doing in\nthere. And I have no reason to think it\nshouldn't. Like really talented people\nworking on it. But like you're just\ngoing to be very surprised by what you\nsee. Like the way it looks, you're not\ngoing to expect. It's not shot like a\nMarvel movie.\n>> Wow. It's It's just You're going to walk\nin there, you're like, \"What?\"\n>> It comes out next year.\n>> Yeah. It'll be like next October,\n>> man.\n>> There's There's There's a scene where I\ngot emotional.\n>> You had to cry and [ __ ]\n>> You might You might see me crying in a\nscene.\n>> So, you must be in the movie a lot. If\nyou had to be over there for two months.\n>> Yeah. Like I'm I'm like with the main\nguy. So, I like I like play like his\nmanager in it without giving away too\nmuch. So, basically most of the stuff\nhe's in, I'm in. Okay.\n>> So, that's why I had to be there. Like,\n>> who's Roman Reigns?\n>> Uh, no. No. Roman Roman is the bad guy.\nHe's like Akuma or Akuma I guess it's\ncalled but uh Ken you know so it's Ryu\nand Ken.\n>> This is a big I don't think people\nrealize how big a deal this movie is. Do\nyou know what Street Fighter meant to\nour childhood? Like it's like Mortal\nKombat and Street Fighter\n>> and and before Mortal Kombat it was\nStreet Fighter.\n>> Yeah. Street Fighter started fighting\ngames like for us. M.\n>> So, like the crazy thing about being on\nthe movie is that everybody around our\nage is super excited because they all\nhave stories, core childhood memories of\nplaying the game, putting their quarter\non the little screen, playing the Marvel\nvs. Capcom game. Remember that one? So,\nlike everybody's excited when they saw\nCody uh Cody Rhodess put the Guile hair\non\n>> like the whole everybody was buzzing.\nThe young kids don't really know it. But\nI think what people are starting to\nrealize about movies now is that just\nputting out a movie that's a good story\nwon't necessarily get people to go to\nthe theater. You got to tap into\nexisting IP.\n>> Tap into emotions, feelings. Yeah.\n>> And there's nothing you care about more\nthan the [ __ ] that impacted you as a\nkid.\n>> This might revitalize the video game.\nCuz I was thinking about that, you know,\neven watching y'all shoot. I'm like,\nthey've done mad Mortal Kombats. Why did\nthey stop doing Street Fighters?\n>> Well, they did one with uh Jeanclaude\nVanam which was like horrible.\n>> I don't even remember that [ __ ]\n>> And like JeanClaude of Vanam. the movie.\nNo, I do remember the movie. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. And it was bad, bro. It was\nlike Sean Club Vanam is playing Guile.\nGuy was supposed to be like the most\nAmerican guy ever,\n>> right?\n>> And Jean Club Vanam got a French accent\nor whatever the [ __ ] he got.\n>> That don't make no sense.\n>> Yeah.\n>> What would you say was like the most\nsurprising thing on set just being there\nfor that long that you weren't\nanticipating? Maybe.\n>> So, I didn't I didn't know how\ncollaborative it was going to be.\n>> Okay. You know, like it it basically\nlike the director Kattow is is the man\nand also the producers like the guys at\nLegendary like Kale and Jay, they\neverybody there wasn't like this ego\nlike sometimes directors and you need a\nlot of ego to be like a director. It's\nlike your vision. But like they were\nsuper collaborative. So they weren't if\nyou had ideas, they wanted to hear them.\nAnd when everybody cares about the\nmovie, like they start really caring\nabout like what their character would do\nand stuff like on some real like actor\n[ __ ] Anytime you see an interview\nsounds wild corny, so even like saying\nit, I'm like I'm like cringing. But\n>> it makes it better to be thinking what\nyour character would do in every\nsituation.\n>> And like we would just take these scenes\nand like make them funnier and build\nthem and make them more\n>> like we were changing [ __ ] kind of on\nthe fly. Like it was So to me that was\nthe thing that I was most scared of. I\nwas like, I don't want to just be\nsitting around all day doing nothing and\nthen saying the lines, but instead it\nwas like, all right, what are we going\nto do to this scene? How are we going to\nmake this better than what's on the\npaper? And um\n>> yeah, you're going to see some wild\n[ __ ]\n>> You said something interesting. You said\nthe movies made in the edit. Man, I did\nnot realize that until I started\nproducing films.\n>> Oh, bro.\n>> Like the [ __ ] like the amount of [ __ ]\nthat they shoot that doesn't get used.\nAnd when you got to like watch these\nthreehour long cuts and you like, \"Huh?\"\nYeah.\n>> Like And when pe I've literally heard a\nproducer say, \"There's a good movie in\nthere.\"\n>> In there.\n>> What the [ __ ]\n>> No, you're right. It's like entire\npeople get cut out of movies.\n>> Yes. Whole scenes, whole\nThey can't do it. They can't do it.\n>> But But that is what happened. Like you\nsaw what happened on I think it was like\nthe Formula 1 movie. Did you hear about\nthat? Like there was a girl who was like\nin the movie. I think she was like the\nlove interest of one of the characters\nand like she was promoting the movie and\nthen she was just completely cut out.\n>> Gone.\n>> How the [ __ ] you do that? How you just\nget rid of the whole character?\n>> I guess that storyline didn't, you know,\nplay a part in it. But but it was it was\n[ __ ] And again, I I didn't even think\nI liked acting. I'll be honest, until I\ndid the movie.\n>> Now, I was going to ask you that, too,\ncuz we had Cardi on Breakfast Club\nrecently, and Cardi said she don't like\nacting. She don't want to do it. She\nsaid she don't like being on sets. she\ndon't like the hurry up and wait [ __ ]\nShe was like, she don't like doing it.\nShe does not want to be an actor. Cuz I\ncuz I asked her about uh it was a movie\nthat she was scheduled to do and I think\nlike the week that they were supposed to\nstart filming, she pulled out.\n>> That is something too that is like I\ndon't really like to do. I always tell\npeople like it's like I don't like sets.\nI don't like waking up at a certain\ntime. I don't I don't like having like a\n>> set schedule.\n>> Set schedule. It's it's just this is why\nI never finished college. Like is that\nit's just certain things are just not\nfor you. Certain responsibilities are\nnot for you. Like I have to do things my\nway, my time.\n>> I don't know how people do it. And then\nit's like I heard I always heard that\nit's like if you start off and you do\nlike a movie and and you do great then\nthe other movie that you make you that's\nwhen you get the big coins. I don't got\ntime to be like I'm getting this.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which by the way I respect. You know\nwhat I mean? because you got to go with\nyour gut your instinct. You know, it\nmight [ __ ] up some business, but you got\nto make yourself happy\n>> and it's a big commitment. You're there\nfor months.\n>> You being a standup comedian podcaster.\nDo you like acting like that,\n>> son? If in a traditional movie where\nit's just like show up, say that line,\nwe're going to record it from this\nangle, this angle, then go home. Like,\nsit in the trailer for 12 hours. I'll go\n[ __ ] crazy.\n>> Like I my brain is not built for that.\nLike I want to talk [ __ ] I want to.\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the fact that we were allowed to\nlike kind of be collaborative in this\nmovie, it's like the in between time\nisn't as boring cuz you're thinking\nabout what would this scene be? What\nwould this character do? How could we\nmake this funnier? And\n>> so it really made me go, I would like to\nbe in a movie but also be producing it.\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Cuz then then you're thinking about not\njust your scene like we were around\nthere watching other people's scenes\nlike pitching lines that would make them\nfunnier.\n>> You know what I mean? And a lot of times\nlike in entertainment [ __ ] only\ncare about themselves so they do their\n[ __ ] and then they go home. But this\nwasn't like that. Like people were\nshowing up to set when they weren't even\nthere\n>> and just hang it.\n>> Wow. I mean they all y'all were in\nAustralia. It's not like they had any\nplace to go.\n>> But\nyou know\n>> you're in Sydney like you could party.\nIt's a real city and like\n>> [ __ ] Rice Spice is walking.\n>> Rice Spice might be there.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Streaming.\n>> Listen that is a great thing to think\nabout cuz I you know we definitely want\nto do a movie. I want to do a brilliant\nidiots flagrant this\n>> guy code mashup written by James Gun.\n>> Bro, you know you DM' me when I was out\nthere.\n>> Get the [ __ ] out of here.\n>> I think he I think he saw us. He said\nthank you for the kind words. I think he\nsaw us talking about Superman on on this\non this podcast.\n>> Get the [ __ ] out of here. Now you got me\nchecking my\nDMs.\n>> You left him on red.\n>> Somebody somebody I know was just with\nJames. Oh no, it was [ __ ] um Alex.\nYeah,\n>> [ __ ] James Gun recorded at one of the\n[ __ ] WTFs. No way.\n>> Yes, [ __ ] HLS.\n>> Yo, James, come on the pod, bro.\n>> How the [ __ ] you don't\n>> James, we need you on the pod.\n>> Yo, James, he he is I I think he's a\nphenomenal comedy writer.\n>> He's the goat.\n>> And he's not even writing actual\ncomedies.\n>> That's what makes it fun. Like yes,\n>> that's what I even we were talking even\nwith not to make it about this point,\nbut it was like the more you can get\npeople convince people that that the\ndrama is real,\n>> the funnier the funny parts will be\nbecause they're breaking up the severity\nof the drama. It's like a a horror\nmovie. Like the the greater the tension,\nthe bigger the the fright.\n>> Think about Friday. Friday, people look\nat Friday as a comedy. That's a [ __ ]\ndrama. That's a drama thriller. You\nknow, [ __ ] Chris Tucker owes Big Worm\nmoney and Big Worm wants to kill them.\nIf you don't have my money by this day,\nyou're going to die. Just think about\nthat. But it's the all the funny that's\nthat's in it. You know what I mean?\nComing to America is a love story. It's\nactually a drama. Think about how,\n>> you know, that must feel to be like,\ndamn, I don't want to marry this woman\njust cuz I'm supposed to. I got to break\nall these royal traditions. I'mma go to\nAmerica, live like a poor person, and\ntry to find love. All the comedy is\nwithin that amazing drama thriller\nstory. That's what the [ __ ] you need.\n>> And that's what everybody who does it\nright gets. It's like I I actually think\nthe funniest movies are the ones where\nwe genuinely believe the drama.\n>> Yes. Not even just movies, real life\nscenarios. Flee Johnson, Booty Warrior.\nHilarious.\n>> Think about that. People have made like\nJames Gun's newest character. We got to\nteach him about Flee Johnson.\n>> Oh, you ain't seen Peacemaker.\n>> You know what I've heard?\n>> Oh my god. Like, but Aaron I mean\n[ __ ] Aaron McGrder that did Flee\nJohnson as the booty warrior on the\nBoondocks. People laugh at that [ __ ]\nMade sketches. But it's a This man was\n>> real.\n>> He was on a what was that show called?\nDate Line or some [ __ ]\n>> Yes.\n>> He was on Dineine on one of them [ __ ]\n>> I saw I saw him on a dating show like an\nonline dating show. See what I'm saying?\n>> Him and uh what was the guy's name? He\nwas from Atlanta. I think he was like\nThug\n>> Woody.\n>> Yeah, him and Woody.\n>> Oh, I did. What? It pop the balloon.\n>> It pop. It was something.\n>> Yeah, they were both there and like\n>> But think about that.\n>> Yeah. How scary that is.\n>> He was rap men, but you watched it and\nevery comedy writer's mind went, \"That's\nhilarious.\"\n>> He describes it like dessert.\n>> Did you like Have you heard him? Like\n>> a memorable story that Fleece told us\nwas about the place and importance that\nbooty has in a maximum security\npenitentiary. And he went on about it\nand on about it\n>> in his prison. Booty\nbooty was uh more important than food.\nBooty a man's butt.\nIt was more important. I'll search it\nwas more booty. Having some booty\nwas more important than drinking water\non me.\n>> I like booty. It is It is just visceral\nthe way he describes it.\n>> Listen, I'm going to be like 56. I want\nto speak that into fruition. A brilliant\nidiot flagrant\nguy code mashup comedy written by James\nGunn. James, we need you.\n>> You know what I'm saying? James, we need\nyou.\n>> Like, that [ __ ] would be hilarious\n>> and serious and dramatic.\n>> Even the [ __ ] that I saw Kevin doing.\nKevin, I I knew about the script anyway,\nbut Kevin Duski and Kai, right?\n>> Yes. They have a movie coming out.\n>> It's a murder who done it.\n>> It's a mystery. Who done it? Like,\nthere's a dead body and it's called The\nLive Scream from Hell. So, it's like,\nyo, that's what you do. You got to put\nthese funny scenarios rooted in like a\nhigh stakes drama situation.\n>> Where where is that? Is that in\ntheaters? Is that streaming? Where is\nthat going to be?\n>> I don't know where it's going to be, but\nif it if they put it on whatever\nstreaming platform it's going to be on,\nit's going to break record.\n>> See you later. It's It's just\ninteresting because\nwhen I was out there, like obviously,\nyou know, a lot of the actors, they're\nlike obsessed with film, you know what I\nmean? Like that is their thing, right?\nAnd we were just talking about the\nindustry in general. And we had this\nconversation and it was like who are the\nyoung there's a difference between a\nmovie star and an actor like a big actor\nand like a movie star they were defining\nas someone who if they're in the movie\npeople show up\n>> okay like for example like\n>> uh Chris Evans I think that's his name\nright the guy who plays Captain America\nlike\n>> amazing is Captain America phenomenal\nBut are we coming because of Chris Evans\nor are we coming because of the IP? That\nis\n>> the IP. Absolutely. Cuz Chris has been\nother in other stuff.\n>> Exactly. But Leonardo DiCaprio can be in\na movie about something we don't even\nknow and we're going to show up first.\n>> How did the new [ __ ] do? How did one\nbattle after another?\n>> Everybody talking about that. Like I'm\nthe most cynical comedian folks that I\nknow that say every movie sucks are like\nthis is the best movie.\n>> I'm going go watch it this weekend. I\ndid a screening for it last week and did\n>> you didn't even watch it? I ain't even\nstay, bro. Bro,\n>> I didn't even stay. They asked me to do\nit. Warner Brothers asked me to do it.\n>> You posted about it and everything.\n>> I did, but you know, you know, they paid\nme to do it, but the thing I liked about\nit, it was, you know, I like anything\nfree for people. So, like, okay, all\nthese people can come for free, but they\nwas like, and also the cast wants to\ncome. I'm like, oh, I'll do it. That's\ncuz that's a and it was surprising the\naudience.\n>> So, we did it at the AMC theater.\nTheater was packed. All these people\ncame just to, you know, cuz I did the\nscreening.\n>> And then Leo walks out. Leo, Tiana\nTaylor. Uh, what's the Spanish guy name?\nUm,\n>> Benio Del Toro.\n>> Benio Del Toro.\n>> Phenomenal actor. Um, the the director\nPaul uh\n>> Thomas Anderson.\n>> Oh, the guy the director Paul Thomas\nAnderson.\n>> Paul Thomas Anderson. Who was there?\nEverybody was there except for Regina\nHall and Sean Pin. So,\n>> yeah.\n>> Chase Infinity.\n>> Yeah. Leonardo DiCaprio was there.\nBenino Del Toro, Tiana Taylor, Chase\nInfinity. Uh, and there was another\nyoung lady there, too.\n>> Hold on.\n>> Yeah, it was a it was she she was a\nblack woman. I can't remember her name,\nbut this was Chase's first movie. Can\nyou imagine your first movie being with\nLeonardo DiCaprio?\nAnd Paul Anderson said it took him two\n20 years to write this film.\n>> I love that.\n>> He said he had this idea for 20 years.\nWhat is her name? Yeah. Shaina Shaya\nMccale.\n>> Shaina Male. Yeah,\n>> bro. Let me tell you how crazy this is.\nI hadn't seen the movie yet, right? So\nwe because we bought the cast out before\nthe movie and I didn't stay for it.\n>> I can't believe you didn't stay for no\nmoney.\n>> So I hear Paul look at Shaina and go\njungle [ __ ]\nSo I'm like wait a minute now. Do I say\nsomething? I don't want to be the woke\nliberal here, right? But do I'm like how\nyou just going turn to the black woman\nand say jungle [ __ ] But nobody else\nreacted. And so I'm like all right maybe\nthis got maybe this is an inside joke\nwith them. That's her name in the movie.\n>> Oh,\nyes.\n>> I didn't know.\n>> He did give her that name. He wrote the\nmovie.\n>> But I don't care. It's a It's a movie,\nthough. I just was like I was a little\nconfused and we're in front of\neverybody. I'm like, yo,\n>> and it's before the movie. Nobody saw\nit.\n>> Oh, no, bro. We got to tell him wait for\nopening weekend to be yelling jungle\n[ __ ] and black one. Come on. Come on,\nPaul. Oh, it did come. It did 22\nmillion. Um, I don't know if that's good\nor bad. I know the budget was crazy.\n>> This movie is going to be great.\n>> It's\n>> the amount of conversation around the\nmovie.\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's very few movies lately that I've\nheard this much talk about it like and\nthey and they did social media, right?\nThey hit the podcast. They did the event\nthat's live like that. Like,\n>> and you know what it is? A thriller\ncomedy. You cannot tell that by the\ntrailer. By the trailer, you do not see\nany comedy in that movie.\n>> Fired. It's like fire is funny as [ __ ]\n>> That's what I heard, too. I heard that\n[ __ ] is hilarious. I'm going go this\nweek. I'm going to go Friday, actually.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I also don't like watching movies at\nscreenings, bro.\n>> You You don't Yeah. You don't like being\naround lots of people?\n>> Nah, I want to go in on a matinea, go in\nthe back of the theater, give my\npopcorn, my peanut M&M. It's like a It's\npeaceful for me. Like, you know what I\nmean? Especially after a long week, you\nknow what I mean? Listening to [ __ ]\nyou know, rappers with their Twitter\nrants and all of this [ __ ] Like, it's\nlike it's like it's like a good week,\nyou know what I mean?\n>> Check out. I want to check out like you\nknow I mean I don't care about this\n[ __ ] You know what I mean? Like Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> But I'm glad you're back man. Me too.\n>> What did you miss the most? What was the\nstory that had you like oh [ __ ] no? Like\nI can't even concentrate on this [ __ ]\nscript.\n>> That Charlie Kirk That Charlie Kirk [ __ ]\nwas wild, bro. That Charlie Kirk [ __ ]\nwas wild.\n>> Um\n>> wow.\n>> I feel like a million things happened.\nLike that's why I did that piece the I\ndid a little piece on the Charlie Kirk\nthere. I was there and it was like I had\nlike a few days off. And I was like, I\ngot to put my brain to work for\nsomething. But uh but yeah, man. I'm\ntrying to think what else what else\nreally\n>> shocked you the most about the Charlie\nKirk situation.\n>> I think it was like how quickly\n>> it was politicized.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Same. Yo,\n>> I mean like that.\n>> Yeah. And it like it kind of demoralized\nme a little bit. Like it kind of made me\nsad\n>> because\nwhat did anybody learn from it? Nothing.\nIt's like any event,\n>> yeah, we live in like this social media\nage, whatever where like there's just so\nmuch information you can confirm\nwhatever you feel, but like think about\nit. Nobody learned anything from it.\nWhatever\nfelt, they just put on top of the issue.\nSo like the second it happened, they\nfound out that the kid's dad was MAGA or\nwhatever like that, and they're like,\n\"See, it's one of you guys.\" And\n>> was he MAGA or just a registered\nRepublican?\n>> Exact whatever. He's a registered\nRepublican. Right. And then and then the\nthe conservatives found out that his\ngirl was a [ __ ] or whatever like that.\nAnd then he was like, \"See, this is what\nhappens.\"\n>> Was that confirmed? He looked like he\nwasn't getting no [ __ ] or [ __ ] or\nwhatever the I don't even know what the\ntussy tussy tussy tussy.\n>> I don't know.\n>> But and then the conspiracy theorists\nwere like, \"Israel did it.\" It's like\nwhat everybody already felt before it\nhappened, they just painted on top of\nwhat happened.\n>> Yeah. And and it was just like the\ndehumanization of it too. Like just the\nthe people that were seemingly\ncelebrating it.\nIt was it was just crazy. It's like wow.\nPeople really they they're not seeing\neach other as as human beings.\n>> I think that uh\nyou know I I I like I like Wayne W.\nDyer, right?\n>> And Wayne W. Dia always talks about\nletting go of your need to be right. And\nI think that everybody needs to let go\nof their need to be right. You should I\npulled this up just to say you should\nchallenge your ego, cultivate humility\nand empathy. Focus on understanding and\ncollaboration rather than personal\nvictory and practice mindfulness and\nself-compassion. We just live in an era\nwhere everybody wants to be right. And\nsometimes these situations aren't even\nabout right. like you should be trying\nto learn something else from said\nsituation. Like what is there to learn\nfrom this Charlie Kirk situation? And\nthat's how I look at every single\nsituation that happens. What are we\nlearning? We're not learning nothing.\nIt's just noise.\n>> Exactly. And like what how is this going\nto change us? How are we going to\nreflect on this and see what we could do\nbetter? Like clearly there's a lot of\ndehumanization going along. So like what\ndo we do about that? Like how do we\nstart to see people as humans? And uh\nthe Charlie thing is like even talking\nabout it, it exposed me cuz I started\nwatching a bunch of his things. He DM'd\nme before by the way, Charlie. And he\ndid something.\n>> Did you talk? Are you?\n>> Yeah. We had like a little interaction\nand he did something that I really I\nreally respect and I understand that he\nis very like, you know, he's he's very\npoliticized and the algorithm has\ncreated different versions of him for\ndifferent people and all that kind of\nstuff. But he he saw a headline of me\nand we'd never spoken. and he hit me up\nand he was just like, \"Hey,\" or maybe we\nhad did before or something like that,\nbut they hit me says, \"Hey, I saw this\nheadline. It seems like you're saying\nthis thing. Is that what you mean?\" And\nI was like, \"No, they're actually taking\nthis thing out of context and this is\nwhat I was actually trying to say.\" And\nblah blah blah. He's like,\n>> he understood. He got it.\n>> Bro, I cannot There are friends, people\nthat I would consider friends, people\nthat I've helped, people that I've\ngotten visas to work in America.\n>> A cush.\n>> No.\nWhat?\n>> Those H1B visas. Oh, no. No. Like like\nthat that that have jumped to make\ncontent off of a headline that was taken\nout of context about me or something\nthat people are framing that I said that\nwasn't that good. And they jump to make\ncontent. They jump to monetize. They\njump to get clicks and views without\nsimply just messaging me and asking for\nclarification. Right.\n>> Well, somebody like Charlie has a\ndifferent lens, right? And the reason I\nsay that is because he's probably a\nperson that they do that to him all the\ntime. So yeah, I get it.\n>> I I honestly think and I know this is\nlike and and again I understand how\nradioactive he is, right? Like there are\ndifferent what this whole thing exposed\nto me is just like how fractured social\nmedia has made\nAmericans but also just like the world.\n>> Oh, it's over.\n>> Because like it No, no, for real. Cuz\ncuz think about like there is a\ndifferent version of Charlie Kirk\ndepending on who you are and the\nalgorithm will feed you the things that\nconfirm your belief about that person.\nSo if you're a like god-fearing\nright-wing Christian, you're going to\nget all this content about Charlie that\nspeaks to that about how important\nfamily is to him, about how important\nhis Christianity, his beliefs are to\nhim, and you're like, \"Wow, this is a\nreally great man.\" And then if you're a\nperson that doesn't like conservative\nrhetoric and you think conservatives are\nbigots, you're going to get all of those\n30 secondond clips with no context of\nall the things that he said. They're\nlike, \"Oh, I don't trust black pilots or\nwhatever the thing is.\" You're not going\nto get the whole conversation where that\nhappened. You're not going to get\nanything that would actually give you\nnuance. So, it's like the algorithm\nflattens all of us, you, me, Charlie,\neverybody, into these two-dimensional\navatars, and then people watch four or\nfive clips where people are reacting to\nthat person and then they go, \"Oh, I\nguess this is what everybody thinks of\nthat person.\" And then people feel\nreally confident having these strong\nopinions on people that they do not know\nat all. I' I've written about this and I\nthink it might have been honest or die\nlying but um we this this era it's like\nthe multiverse right so that's why\nthat's why when people say like\n>> you know oh I don't like Charlemagne it\ndoesn't offend me and the reason it\ndoesn't offend me is because I don't\nknow what version of Charlemagne you\nwitnessed you know what I'm saying like\nit don't bother me you might have saw\nsomething from 10 years ago you might\nhave saw something from recently that\nyou don't like but then you also might\nhave saw me over here talking about\nmental health you might have saw me over\nhere talking about, you know, having a\npolitical take. There's so many\ndifferent versions of us that exist.\nLike I can literally go down my timeline\nfor one story and it'll be like, \"You\ndidn't support Kla Harris.\" And then\nliterally the next comment will be like,\n\"See, this is why Democrats will never\nwin cuz people like Charlemagne can't\nstop blazing Kla Harris.\" Like\nliterally, it'll be the comments back to\nback. This I'm talking about this\nhappened one minute, this happened the\nnext minute. So, it's just like what are\nyou supposed to do with that? I don't\nI'm not I'm not upset about anybody's\nopinion of me because I just don't know\nwhat they saw to have that opinion.\n>> So So back in the day there was this\nthing that I think John Stewart referred\nto as like the laundering of news and it\nwas like the uh Fox News to New York\nPost uh pipeline. I don't know if you've\nheard about this. So like on Fox News\nthere'd be like an opinion piece, right?\nAnd then that would happen like earlier\nin the day and then by the night that\nopinion piece would be reported on by\nthe news and then in the morning it\nwould be the front page of the post. So\nyou take an opinion and then you turn it\ninto fact.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> And now we don't really trust like\ntraditional media anymore, right? Like\nso this is part of Trump going fake\nnews. It's also part of like legacy\nmedia, you know, pushing us into [ __ ]\nwars and lying about weapons of mass\ndestruction for years. So, we have like\nlost some faith. But for some reason, we\nbelieve if we see a random person on\nTikTok saying something in their house\n>> and they don't know what the [ __ ] they\ntalking about either.\n>> Exactly. None of these people No, they\ndon't know. There's no facteing,\nnothing. But what it is is we don't It's\nnot that we believe them. It's if we see\nfour or five videos in a row, we think\nthat's what everyone feels. Yeah.\n>> And then we start going, well, if I\ndon't feel that way, then I'll be an\n>> Yo, I hear people say stuff like that.\nThey'll be like, you know, this\nconversation is going all around the\nworld cuz that's what their algorithm\nmakes them feel. It's probably 20\npeople, bro.\n>> Like, it's literally probably 20 [ __ ]\npeople. You know, the best conversation\nI saw about the Charlie Kirk [ __ ] Tanya\nCo and Ezra Klein.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> You know why? cuz it was a good faith\nconversation.\n>> Yes.\n>> And it was two people who had two\ndifferent opinions. Yep.\n>> They agreed to disagree. And I don't\nthink either one of them were really\nthat far apart on what they wanted their\nultimate goal to be with said\nconversation. I think both of them were\nlooking for sanity.\n>> Yeah.\n>> In all of this chaos. Yeah.\n>> You know what I'm saying? And and and\nTanya had a a perspective and Ezra had a\nperspective. And I don't even think\nEzra's perspective was what Tanahesi\nthought it was. Like Tanis, and I'm I'm\nprobably pronouncing Tanahesi's name all\nwrong, but y'all know I can't pronounce\n[ __ ]\n>> Just do go with Coats.\n>> Coats. Mr. Coats. I think that Mr. Coats\n>> was saying he didn't like the\nwhitewashing\n>> of Charlie Kirk, right? Because\n>> you should be able to discuss somebody's\nwhen they pass, you should be able to\ndiscuss them in their whole totality.\nLike you shouldn't nothing should be\nfragmented. Everything should be on the\ntable and you can you can acknowledge\nwhat happened to him was wrong.\n>> Yes.\n>> You know what I'm saying? What happened\nto him was wrong. What happened to him\nwas tragic. I wouldn't wish that on\nanybody, right? Cuz I wouldn't want\nsomething like that to happen to me just\ncuz somebody doesn't agree with my\nopinion. But we should still be able to\ndiscuss their whole legacy and its, you\nknow, totality. And I guess that's the\nthat's what he didn't like about Ezra\nKlein's um approach. I don't even think\nthat's what Ezra was trying to do. No, I\ndon't think I think what Ezra is trying\nto do is is basically say like we have\nto wide if you actually want to win an\nelection, you have to widen the scope of\nacceptability of the people into your\ncoalition. So, it's like if Democrats\nare going to win, they can't just be\npointing fingers and saying that people\naren't good enough and that they're not\nliberal enough and they're not accepting\nenough, right?\n>> That's why he brought up the deplorables\nwith Hillary Clinton.\n>> With Hillary Clinton and like I actually\nthink what what Ezra is saying is like\nhe's operating in the real world. Ezra\nis going, \"Hey, I actually care about\nwinning elections.\"\n>> Sure, sure.\n>> Said, \"I would have never said the\ndeplorable comment.\"\n>> I've been obsessing recently for a piece\nI've been writing about the Hillary\nClinton deplorables comment, and I want\nto play it.\n>> You know, to just be grossly\ngeneralistic,\nyou can put half of Trump's supporters\ninto what I call the basket of\ndeplorables,\nright?\nthe racist, sexist, homophobic,\nxenophobic,\nislamophobic, you name it.\nAnd unfortunately, there are\npeople like that.\nAnd he has lifted them up. He has given\nvoice to their websites that used to\nonly have 11,000 people, now have 11\nmillion. He tweets and retweets.\nThey're offensive, hateful,\nmean-spirited\nrhetoric.\nNow, some of those folks, they are\nirredeemable, but thankfully they are\nnot American.\n>> What do you think when you hear that?\n>> She probably shouldn't have said it,\n>> but you think it's true.\n>> I mean, it's probably not how I would\nsay it, but you know what I mean? There\nare things that I would say.\n>> Mhm. You know, um I probably would say\nwhat I said earlier, you know, in the\ninterview about the force of and I've\nbeen I mean, as I've been saying this\nprobably since as long as we've been\ntalking.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, but I'm not I just want to be\nclear about something.\n>> I shouldn't be running for president of\nthe United States. You know what I mean?\nAnd my expectations for the rhetoric of\nwriters, intellectuals, journalists,\netc. is very, very different than what\nthe expectation should be for people who\nwho, you know, expect to hold office.\n>> Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. But what Ezra is\ndoing is like when you actually want to\nwin an election, you have to have this\ntype of like language and rhetoric,\nright?\n>> And that's exactly why they were on the\nsame page. Remember that what I before\nwe walked in, I was telling Chris, the\nreason I like that combo and the thing\nthat I think is getting lost in that is\nwhat Tanahasi was saying about how you\nwin elections. He essentially was saying\nlike, I don't want Barack Obama\n>> saying certain things cuz I know he\ncan't win.\n>> You know what I mean?\n>> Who was saying that?\n>> Tanahasi. Yeah. So, so I don't I don't\nknow if it was about reparations or not.\nIt might have been about rep or he was\nhe was talk I think it might have been\nabout reparations cuz he was talking\nabout how it was an article he wrote\ncalled\n>> but he said the thing about uh it was\nKamla remember he was like I I had to go\nspeak to these people who are uh these\nPalestinian people who are suffering\nbased on what's happening in Palestine\nright now but I had to tell them I got\nto support this woman who was doing\nnothing during the Biden uh\nadministration would continue to do\nnothing afterwards because of something\nI want.\n>> I can give you an example from the other\nside by the way too. Yeah, go for it,\n>> brother. You know um what my position\nwas\num during the election about Palestine,\n>> about Gaza.\nKla Harris\nwas running to be the first black woman\nto be president of the United States.\nYou cannot imagine how animated black\nfolks were. And some would argue the\nbase of the Democratic party, black\nwomen, you know, we're going to, you\nknow, see this thing. he was not taking\na position that I thought was\nparticularly moral.\nI had to talk in front of black\naudiences about that. You know what I\nmean? And and I had to do the other\nthing, which was go before Arab-American\naudiences here, Palestinian-American\naudiences here, and say, \"Look, I'm with\nyou. You can be mad at me. You probably\nwill be mad at me. I get it. But for me,\npolitics is the, you know, the lesser of\ntwo evils. We have been fighting this\nbattle for a long time. We have never\nhad the luxury of electing people that\nrepresented the the the best of us. And\nthis is why I'm voting for her. This is\na really really serious thing. And when\nyou hear these Palestinians, Palestinian\nAmericans, and when you hear these\nMuslim Americans and when you hear these\nArab Americans upset about this, you\nknow, you you can't just yell at them.\nYou have to take them seriously. These\nwere hard, very, very difficult\nconversations. But they would when I\nmade those conversations, look man, I\nhad to be buttoned up about it\n>> and like that's a mature way of looking\nat politics. But the problem is\nthe algorithm does not care about mature\nways of looking at anything. If you look\nat a lot of the reaction to that\ninterview same conversation, it's\nfingerpointing. It's oh Ezra missed this\nand oh time see this that and it's just\nlike cuz that's what works. The rage\nbait works online. And I actually hit up\nEzra about that. I was like, \"You're\ndoing the right thing, but you got to I\nhope you're ready for when you're a\nnuanced person, you get to piss off\neverybody,\n>> right?\n>> Cuz there's so much reward online and\nengaging in saying, \"Oh, this person's\nsitting on the fence or this person.\nMaybe we need to get closer to the\nfence.\"\n>> I enjoyed the Listen, I enjoyed the\nconversation. I thought they they\nprobably agreed on more things than they\nthat they disagreed on. But even when\nthey disagreed it was just a civil good\nfaith conversation. Yes.\n>> They're also friends which helps.\n>> Yeah, sure. Yeah. And that kind of\nstuff. And then\n>> you know that there was a point where I\nthink that like uh I think Tanahasi was\nlike like I have a different\nresponsibility. I'm a journalist, right?\nLike so I think I talk about these\nthings and I share my opinions on this.\nI'm not like running for elected office\netc.\n>> Yes. But that's real though, right? And\nyou know who's dealing with that right\nnow? Zoran Mandani.\n>> You know what I'm saying? Like it's\ndifferent when you an activist and you\nsaying certain things, but now you\nrunning for office. You get to the\nfinish line, you like, oh,\n>> you got to pull people in.\n>> And and you and those same people that\nwere supporting them, you got a lot of\npeople that's just like, \"What are you\ndoing? Why did you say that?\" Blah,\nblah, blah. It's just like, yo, he's\ntrying to win an election, y'all.\n>> Yeah. Like if you really believe he is\nwho he says he is and you believe that\nhe's going to implement change, let him\ngo out there and [ __ ] cook. But\nokay,\n>> but it's not good enough for people. And\nwhat people can't do is look at human\nbeings as three-dimensional beings,\nright? It's like we It's so funny.\n>> There are opinions that I'm sure a\nCharlie Kirk has or a Tanahasi codes or\nor any of these figures, right? Not\nsaying they're the same, but like\nthey're opinions that they might have\nthat you disagree with. They're opinions\nthat you disagree with with your dad or\nyour grandfather.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Your family members might have really\nbigoted opinions about certain things\nthat you think are deplorable, but at\nthe same time, you love how they treat\ntheir grandma. They were at every single\none of your football games. You know,\nthey love you more than anything in the\nworld. So, it doesn't make sense.\n>> But would you love them the same way if\nthey had the ability in scale to impact\npeople's lives?\n>> No, no, no, no. That that's not let me\nget to that point because I think what\nyou're saying is makes sense. What I'm\nsaying is you have the ability to just\nsee them as a human,\n>> right?\n>> You see things that they have that are\nflaws.\n>> Sure.\n>> But they're still a human. But right now\nwith so with the way that we consume all\ninformation on social media, there is no\nhumanity. All you are are a collection\nof ideas that I hate or a collection of\nideas that I love.\n>> There's extreme reactions. And the\nproblem with that is that if you're a\ncollection of ideas that I hate, right?\nRight. Then somebody shoots you and then\npeople celebrate because the thing that\nyou hate instead of looking at that\nperson like that's also a father and\nthat's also somebody who was trying to\nmake the world a better place and what\nhe saw and he was driven by God.\n>> You're absolutely right. What you're\nsaying is we we're making everybody\ndisposable.\n>> Yes.\n>> We're making everybody disposable. Even\nwhen we say things like, \"Oh, they're\ncanceled. They're dumb.\" Like you're\nliterally making humans disposable.\n>> We have more empathy.\n>> Yeah.\n>> For people outside of our country that\nwe disagree with than people inside of\nour country. And I understand that\nproximity increases fear, which is what\nyou're talking about, right? But like\nthere are people there are people I'm\nsure around the world that we deeply\ncare about. Like obviously you see like\nthe care like people bring this up all\nthe time. They're like, \"How stupid is\nit there are queers for Palestine?\" Like\nthey bring up this argument. It's like\nthat's actually not stupid. That's\nincredible humanity. Caring about\nsomeone's life, right?\n>> Even though they might disagree with\nyours, that's not a stupid person.\nThat's an amazingly beautiful,\nopen-minded person that goes, \"That\nperson disagrees with me on maybe the\nmost fundamental thing that I care\nabout, but they're still a [ __ ] human\nbeing. So, I want them to exist.\"\n>> That is like I wish that we had that\ntype of empathy for our fellow Americans\nand not just the people abroad.\n>> There's got to be some sodomy going on\nin Palestine though, right? Like I'm\njust saying there's got to be some down.\nI know it's a religious thing, but\nthere's got to be, right? Like\n>> I mean the the reason hummus was\ninvented was lube.\n[Laughter]\nsome tasty little there's a famous quote\nabout I mean it's no\n>> what is the quote\n>> there's a town in and the quote is the\nbirds fly over with one wing cuz they\nhave to cover their ass with their other\nwing\n>> god damn\n>> I know but that is real\n>> what the [ __ ] is that about\n>> I don't know\n>> what\n>> but I read it\n>> who's [ __ ] the birds that Jesus\n>> if it moves\n>> if it moves Are they [ __ ] anything?\n>> Yeah, someone already got that goat.\n>> What?\n>> That goat. That goat's tired. That goat\nhad a long day. That goat had a long\nday.\n>> Why they don't want the women though?\n>> No, they do want the women, man. But you\ngot to marry them.\n>> You don't got to marry the goat. You got\nto marinate them.\n>> Maybe that's I'm not Let me leave them\nalone. Okay.\n>> I can make that joke. I'm Scottish.

That means that uh people federal\nworkers won't be getting paid. That\nmeans federal workers will be getting\nfurled. That means that, you know, if\nyou're not cons No, that means that even\nif you're an essential worker, you still\ngot to go to work. You still don't get a\ncheck. That means that active duty\ntroops still got to report to duty and\nnot get paid.\n>> Oh, wow.\n>> It's it's silly. And you know it's the\nthe illst thing about this is that\nRepublicans have found a way to blame\nthis on Democrats, but Republicans,\ny'all have all the power.\n>> Why? Yeah. Don't they control?\n>> You control everything.\n>> So who are the dissensing votes?\n>> They blamed it on I've seen them I've\nseen them blame it on one person who\n>> AOC.\n>> But how I don't even know\ny'all I saw Nancy on Fox. I think Nancy\nwas on Fox. Nancy M. Nancy say, \"I just\nwant y'all to know that the government\nis shut down because of a former\nbartender from the Bronx.\"\n>> Everyone needs to know that the\ngovernment is shutting down tonight\nbecause of a bartender from the Bronx.\nChuck Schumer is so afraid of AOC\nprimarying him for the US Senate in New\nYork. That's what this is all about. So,\nhe's catering to the far far left of his\nparty. The other thing is they'd rather\nfund healthcare for illegal aliens than\npay our troops. Like that's where we are\ntonight and good luck with that in the\nmidterms.\n>> Come on, man.\n>> Like, god damn. Here's here's But how\ncome Democrats can't message that\nRepublicans, y'all have all the power.\nY'all are the ones in control. Y'all are\nthe government right now. Y'all chose to\ndo this. I think the tricky thing with\nDems right now is uh\nthe establishment Democrats\nhave nothing to offer and the American\npeople know that.\n>> Dems are walking into Congress with one\nhand over their [ __ ] Okay, they\nwalking into they walking in the\ngovernment one hand over the [ __ ] cuz\nthey getting [ __ ] at every turn.\n>> Lindsey Graham is right there, bro.\nLindy's like finally.\nNo, but but like the the established\nones really just have nothing to offer\nthe American people. The new Democrats,\nright, the Zora Mdanis,\nthe AOC's, and then Bernie, the guy who\nhas been spearheaded this movement, they\nhave something to offer. And the reason\nI know that they have something to offer\nis they don't talk about Trump\nconstantly.\nAll Mani talks about New York. He talks\nabout what he wants to do with New York.\nLike his ideas or hate his ideas, that's\nfine. You can be critical of someone's\nideas. This is America. But he actually\nhas something to offer. He believes he\nhas something to offer people. He goes,\n\"Hey, we're going to do things to help\nyour life.\" The establishment Democrats,\nthis is kind of what I realized. I was\nlike, \"Oh, they got nothing to offer.\"\n>> So, so the only thing they could do is\ngo, \"He's bad. Look how bad he is.\"\n>> I watched him on CNN. He did an\ninterview with Aaron Bernett the other\nday, and it was a good interview. And\nyes, he was just dropping what he wanted\nto do, all his policies. And they asked\nhim about Trump calling him a communist,\nand he didn't even stay on that too\nlong.\n>> Bro, think about think about you're a\nrestaurant, right? How do you promote\npeople to come into your restaurant? Do\nyou say, \"Yo, all those other\nrestaurants are horrible. You don't want\nto eat there. Their food is bad.\" Or do\nyou talk about how delicious your food\nis?\n>> If you got good food, tell me about it.\n>> But if you got nothing to sell, then all\nyou can do is slander the opposition.\nMadani is going to be a either a home\nrun or a big swing and a miss though.\n>> If he wins.\n>> If he wins.\n>> If Listen, if he wins and it's a swing\nand a miss, right? Like that is a\ndevastating blow. I But I think that the\nswing of the miss might come from him\nnot being able to implement the things.\n>> Simple as that. But that's why it's a\nswing and a miss. So it's like you got\nto you still got to temper people's\nexpectations. I I believe that I keep\ntelling people go back and watch what\nPresident Obama said when they was\ncampaigning with Kamla and and the way\nhe spoke about how sometimes and I'm\nparaphrasing but how sometimes Democrats\njust promise too much. You just promise\nthe world the people politicians do that\nin general like every they just they\npromise the world promise the world and\nthen people are are micromanaging things\nso much now like they're like well you\nsaid you was going to do X Y and Z and\nyou didn't do this. So they're going to\nbe on Mandani about getting a lot of the\nthings that he said he was going to do\ndone. And when he's not going to be able\nto implement those things since people\ndon't understand politics, they going to\ncrucify him for it. And then he's going\nto also have to play ball.\n>> But I mean, hasn't Trump promised 500\nthings in the first month of his second\nadministration? None of them came to\npass. It doesn't seem to impact him. I\nmean, there's one twice already.\n>> No, but you know why it doesn't impact\nhim? Why\n>> is because there there's nothing else\nthat is being offered up. All it is is\nwhining and crying about Trump. Tell us,\nwill a Will a Democrat come out and tell\nus how they're going to make people's\nlives better?\n>> I think they have. It just doesn't\nresonate. I I get emails every day from\nJeff and they're laying out. No, but\nthat's that's to my point.\n>> People are are laying out plans and\ngiving specifics.\n>> Most people just specifically say\n>> I can go to my email right now every\nday. This guy emails me every day of the\nweek.\n>> Hakeem definitely got his butthole\ncoming.\n>> So the point is we don't want to hear it\nanymore from a certain part of that\nparty, right? And part of it is that\nMandami has new ideas that have kind of\nrisen above the noise. But I think it's\nalso just like fresh energy on a certain\nlevel is is resonating with people.\n>> I agree. But I I think, you know,\nlisten, if he wins, like I said, he's\ngoing to have to get things done. Well,\nwhat does he have what does he have to\ndo to win?\n>> Oh, right now you need some black people\nand some Jewish people on his side.\n>> Good luck.\n>> I think\nMdani is a perfect example of what we're\ntalking about about like the flattening\nof people. Yeah.\n>> Like there are certain people that truly\njust believe he is a anti-semitic\ncommunist. They they literally believe\nthat is who he is as a person. And then\nthere's other people that believe that\nhe's a young, smart liberator that's\ntrying to help people that are\nstruggling to make it through in a very\nexpensive city. This is the same person.\nAnd online there are two different\nversions of him.\n>> Maybe 10.\n>> No, exactly. There's 20. There's a\nmillion different ones. And it's like\n>> Muslims got mad at him the other day cuz\nhe said he wanted to decriminalize\nprostitution.\n>> Yeah.\n>> When he was on Rosanne Scott, like he\nkind of had to explain that.\n>> Do Do you support decriminalizing\nprostitution?\n>> Yes. Right now, what we see in this\nmoment is we have an approach that is\nnot putting safety first. What we saw\nwith the previous mayor administration\nwas an end to the raids that we saw on\nsex workers, an end to prosecutions that\nwere taking place of sex workers\nthemselves. What we have to bring to\ncity hall is a focus on ending sex\ntrafficking, on ensuring that there is\nno tolerance for violence against women,\nand also having safety at the\ncornerstone of all the policies that we\npursue. And when we look at the findings\nof whether it be the World Health\nOrganizations or the United Nations\nworking group on the safety of girls and\nwomen, we find that decriminalization is\none that actually provides the most\nsafety for these.\n>> I know a lot of people are concerned\nabout the young girls being trafficked.\n>> But Muslims like what mean you want to\ndecriminalize prostitution?\n>> Like even though Diddy would love that,\nright? But\n>> and he won't do it anyway. So what's the\ndifference?\n>> But he said he wanted to.\nWell, I don't know. I think the crime\nthing is going to be a challenge for\nhim.\n>> The crime thing\n>> it's a challenge for me. Like if I had\none one reservation, it's I I've often\nsaid I'm a little more like pro policing\nthan probably a lot of other people who\nshare ideas with me and like\n>> bro, it doesn't work. This idea like\n>> the fund's not going to work.\n>> I like I like what he says when he says\nrefund social services though.\n>> Sure. You look at the end of the day,\nyou don't do something because you're\nworried about the punishment. I would\nlove for us to sit here and go like\nwe're not going to do it because you\nknow forgiveness is important and we're\nall know how and if we had the right\nopportunity we had the right money we\nwould do the right thing. You know how\nmany friends of mine that came from like\nupper middle class backgrounds ended up\nselling drugs because it was fun and\nthey were lazy.\n>> Damn.\n>> You know it's just like this you need\npunishment unfortunately we are human\nbeings.\n>> Yeah. I think\n>> well we have punishment. I don't know if\nwe have enforcement all the time and\nthat's the issue.\n>> I think there's a great it's don't\nreally have punishment. It's catch and\nrelease.\n>> Yeah, you're right.\n>> So, like you need a I promise you you\nstart punishing people, they'll stop\ncommitting crimes immediately.\n>> But but show us what happens when you\npunish them, right? Like catch and\nrelease is one thing, but okay, let's\nsay you catch somebody who has been\ncommitting crimes, right?\n>> What happens when they're in the system?\nAre you actually trying to make them\nbetter? They call it a correctional\nsystem. Are you actually trying to\ncorrect anything? Are you teaching them\nhow to eat better? Are you giving them\nproper mental health services? Are you\nletting them learn a trade that they can\ntake with them when they do get out into\nsociety? Are you, you know, giving them\na a higher education while they're in\nthere? Like, don't just take these\npeople and lock them up and throw away\nthe key. There should be some\nrehabilitation for these people so when\nthey go back out in the streets, then\nmaybe they can go find a job and don't\nhave to resort to a life of crime. If\nyou're putting them in a situation where\nthey go into these jails and now they\njust got to survive, one hand on their\n[ __ ] butthole. You know what\nI'm saying? Literally, right? They\nbecome more\n>> savage. They become more\n>> No, you're right.\n>> of of an animal. Like, let's\nrehabilitate these people and then send\nthem back out. But there is one line\nbetween this conversation and the\nCharlie Kirk conversation that I feel is\nat the core of it. But\n>> talk to me.\n>> Guns.\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm not just I'm\nnot Listen, I'm I'm a 2A all day. I\nbelieve in my right to bear arms, but I\nalso believe in common sense gun reform.\nI believe in common sense gun\nlegislation. Some of these weapons don't\nneed to be on the [ __ ]\n>> 80% of people believe in it.\n>> You know, it is a too many. We thought\nwe had a scooter problem. No, no. Nobody\nthought that but you, Chris.\n>> The guns. Problem one and one a.\n>> Problem one and one a.\n>> Guns and scooters. RIP Eric Adams\nfinally came out against scooters right\nat the end.\n>> You said RIP Eric Adams\n>> to his candidacy.\n>> Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> But he he took a hard stand at the end.\nPut took a hard stand on scooters at the\nend. I'll respect him for it.\n>> But Chris, I'm going be honest with you.\nThis is one of the problems with\nliberals. We in here talking about some\nreal [ __ ] And you bring up scooters.\nYou know what I'm saying?\n>> Hey, violence is violence.\n>> Got to stop these school scooter. The\nschool sc schoolings, man.\n>> These schoolings, man. These school.\nIt's too many mass school scootings in\nAmerica shows. We got to stop.\nOkay. It's too many mass school\nscootings. Man,\n>> it is crazy that like with Trump\ndropping the ball on so many of the\nthings that he promised that Democrats\nhaven't been able to like pick up steam.\n>> What is that?\n>> But yo, we've said that and we said this\na million times. Yes, we know Trump is\ngoing to fumble, but the Democrats don't\nhave the team to pick up the [ __ ]\nball.\n>> But why is that? And it seems that like\npeople are I don't know. Maybe they're\nangry.\nI don't know. There's just like a lot of\nregret.\n>> I I got thoughts I got plenty of\nthoughts on that. I I've said it a\nmillion times. I think because they\nhaven't acknowledged\nthe big lie yet.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now now Kamla has done it in her book\n107 days. The original sin did it. Karen\nJohn Pierre got a book coming out. But\nmore Democrats have to acknowledge the\nbig lie.\n>> Throw that old regime under the bus and\nliterally just it needs to be blown up.\n>> The amount of people Let me tell you how\nuh how uh how like what is it when\nyou're not willing to reflect? You're\njust, you know, when you ignore your\nproblems. What is that word?\n>> Not having any mirrors. I don't know.\n>> No, but literally it's like um Oh god, I\ncan't believe I'm forgetting this word.\nBut uh the lack of like self-reflection\nor\n>> self-awareness.\n>> Yeah, self-awareness or like you you\njust not facing your problem.\n>> Accountability.\n>> You're ignoring you the lack of\naccountability or whatever it is.\nbasically um the amount of like DMs or\nlike or like tweets or whatever I'll get\nright about people that literally think\nthat like me, Joe Rogan, and Theo Vaughn\nare responsible for Trump becoming\npresident\nthat don't think that the fact that\nDemocrats ran a dead guy and then a\nwoman that couldn't talk had anything to\ndo with it just shows that they're not\nwilling to be in reality. Like all these\npeople are just like, \"Let's ignore\nwhat's happening in our house and let's\npoint blame. Let's scapegoat. Let's find\nout what's going on in the world.\" It's\nlike you ran a dead guy that we all knew\nwere dead. You gas lit us into thinking\nthat he wasn't. And now you're writing\nbooks about how he was. And then you ran\na very unpopular candidate that said she\nwas going to do all the same things as\nthe dead.\n>> You ran the running mate of one of the\nmost unpopular presidents ever. And you\ngave her 107 days to do it when her\napproval ratings was lower than him. So,\nnot only does she have to dig herself up\nout of that grave, she got to do some\nallow me to reintroduce myself [ __ ] And\nthat's impossible to do in 107 days.\nThat's why I I genuinely enjoyed her\nbook, man. I enjoyed her book because\nthere was accountability there. I've\nseen people say it's a book full of\nexcuses. It is, but like who doesn't\nhave excuses when they lose, right? And\nand by the way, I wouldn't even call\nthem excuses so much as to say,\n>> does she acknowledge not coming on the\npods?\n>> Yes.\n>> That's another revision. She she has a\nwhole chapter about Joe Rogan how she\nsaid people completely [ __ ] that up.\nShe actually said and now hold me make\nsure I'm getting that right. She\nactually said it was Rogan's team that\nwas uh not being honest about that\nsituation.\n>> Yeah, I bet.\n>> Uh let me make sure.\n>> I mean, I know for a fact her team has\nlied about us. Like 100% fact.\n>> Yeah. She said she wanted to appear on\nRoland's podcast on October 25th, 2024,\nbut he chose to interview Donald Trump\ninstead. that she alleges that Rogan\nlater made false claims that her\ncampaign had placed restrictions on\ntopics for the interview. In late 2024,\nHarris campaign made an offer for a\n1-hour off-site interview in DC, where\nRogan insisted on an open-ended instudio\nconversation in Austin, which her team\nrejected. A suggested that some of her\nmore progressive advisers were concerned\nabout the optics of an appearance on\nRogan's podcast, given this history of\ncontroversial remarks. He talks about\nall of this in the book,\n>> but it's just so like\n>> it's just so interesting that like the\nrevisionist history is that like Trump\nwins because he comes on these comedians\npodcast\n>> as opposed to the other side just being\nbad.\n>> The though the the other side was also\ninvited onto\nlike how how are we responsible for\ntheir bad decisions?\n>> You're going to you're going to be\ntalking about this till the day you die.\n>> Who is me?\n>> Yes.\n>> Why? because it's actually a moment in\ntime whether we realize it or not. You\ndon't realize it till you like, damn,\nthis isn't a book.\n>> Like you read these things, they're in\nbooks. Like\n>> we're part of history. Like whether you\nwant to whether you want to be or not.\n>> It's similar to 1960 in a way.\n>> I wasn't there, Chris. What happened?\n>> Neither was I.\n>> What happened? What happened?\n>> But I've read about it in books.\n>> Talk to me.\n>> So there was a technological shift in\n1960. The debate between Kennedy and\nNixon was the first presidential debate\nthat was ever televised. So coming into\nit, Kennedy was young and vibrant\n>> and energized and Nixon was old.\nCompounding that, he like hit his knee\nagainst his car door.\n>> He had an injured knee and he was like\nsweating and like\n>> freaking out. And that's in retrospect\nwhat people say shifted the election\nbecause the technology had changed and\npeople had never had a chance to see\nuh the candidates before and there was\nsuch a stark contrast and I think with\npodcasting and the shift in media for\nthis election it's the same thing where\nthere's this shift happening in one\nspace and then the politics kind of\ndubtales into it and you have that big\nchange. Can I can I can I can I bring up\nsomething about this which is I'll tie\nit back in. Okay.\n>> There's no young like movie stars right\nnow. There's no young like action star.\nTimothy I would say he's a he's a movie\nstar but he's not like a um he's not\nlike a young\n>> box office yet.\n>> No no no no. I'm I'm not being critical\nof Timmy. Like obviously he's very\nsuccessful and he's talented but like\noutside of like Timothy it's like who\nwas the young Tom Cruz? Like when we\nwere growing up there were all these\nguys. There was Bruce Willis. There was\nlike 20 different young actors that were\nlike,\n>> \"It's not Timothy.\"\n>> No, no, he's one. But I'm saying like\nhe's one like and I don't even know.\n>> I would have to ask my daughter like\nshe'd be into those\n>> because there were only a limited amount\nof platforms when we were growing up.\n>> Well, well, yes, but I also think what\nhappened is I think that Hollywood kind\nof ignored what was happening. I think\nwhat happens is less people were going\nto movies. Hollywood got scared. They\nstarted putting the same stars that they\nknow could draw in movies. Like Tom Cruz\nis still doing Mission Impossible,\nright? Like he's 70 years old. Like he's\nstill hanging off of planes. He's seven.\nLike they haven't gotten the 50-year-old\nversion of that. Like the 30, the 20.\nLike, so I think what Hollywood did is\nthey started to freak out and they\nstarted, okay, let's keep on putting\nIndiana Jones in movies. Let's keep on\ndoing the folks that are watching.\n>> They were trying to play it safe.\n>> They're they're trying to play it safe\nbecause the bud the budgets are 200\nmillion, etc. And then what happened is\nthe next crop of young entertainers\ndon't end up going into Hollywood. They\nend up streaming. They're high, right?\nThey're Drewuski. There's a bunch of\ncomedians like myself. Like now we're\ngoing into movies, but like we're\nbasically the younger crop of\nentertainers that if this was 30 years\nago, you don't think Kai or Drewki would\nbe in every single movie? They would.\nThey would be Eddie Murphy. They would\nbe Jim Carrey. I think back in the day.\nThe reason why I say I don't know cuz\nnone of those [ __ ] in Hollywood\nhave ever shown us that they know real\nraw talent.\n>> No. Well, you know what I'm saying? Like\nyou really had to pick your hand. You\nhad to be the bird that take your hand\noff the wing. You had to be the bird\nthat takes your wing off [ __ ] and go\nin the go in these studios ass first.\nAss first. Mouthful,\n>> right? You know what I'm saying?\n>> Is it a coincidence that all of these\nguys that you named\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right. A lot of these Hollywood types\n>> have all of these rumors.\n>> No.\n>> If you understand what I'm saying, where\ndid those rumors come from? I don't\nknow.\n>> Huh? Were they naturally born that way?\n>> Or did they become that way because of\nopportunity? My point is the Kais, the\nDrewkis, the U's. I don't know if\nHollywood ever sees y'all, bro. But I'm\nbeing honest.\n>> No, no. 100% Hollywood Hollywood is just\nstarting to see comedy, right? They're\njust starting to see comedians. They\ndon't even know streaming exists. Like\nthe fact that this movie is happening\nwith them is massive. But if if Kevin\nHart\n>> doesn't go, I want to do this movie.\nThat's not happening. And he's a major\nmovie star, right? It's Kevin's ability\nto recognize what was actually happening\nwhere the youth is, where the kids are.\nLike think about podcasting. Like\n>> Kamla thought that it was in her best\ninterest to not go on the biggest\nplatforms on the planet. I do think\nKamla did a combination of both, but she\nshe did miss big platforms like Rogan,\nlike Flagrin, but I think that she did\nwhat you should do because we live in a\nworld now where you just have to be in\nfront of as many eyeballs as possible.\n>> Sure.\n>> Like I was at I did a upfront for\nNielsson this week and I think what\nNeilson is doing is dope now because all\nof this stuff is going to account for\nratings now. Like it's not just\n>> people listening to radio, it's podcast,\nit's all social media, like everything\nis combined now. I'm giving you the the\nthe behind the scenes. Yeah. not\neducated technical version of it, right?\nBut\n>> that's what you have to do. I think she\ndid a good job of that. You should go on\nthe view, but then you shouldn't go do\nAll the Smoke, right? You should go on\nSteven Cob, but you should also go do\n>> she did a bunch of podcast. It was just\n>> Trump didn't do that because he didn't\nhave to. He's been campaigning for 10\nyears. I don't need to go on your\nmainstream platforms. I can go on all of\nthese podcasts and you got to talk about\nme anyway.\n>> But he did go on a bunch of them. He did\nhe did\n>> Oh, he didn't do no mainstream stuff.\n>> He outside of Fox. Other than that, it\nwas strictly podcast. He didn't do any\nHe didn't do none of the late night\nshows, none of the daytime television,\nnothing.\n>> But he It's not like he went on Pod Save\nAmerica.\n>> He Yeah, that's true.\n>> That would have been the You know,\n>> that would have been great.\n>> He didn't ran circles around him.\n>> I guess\n>> he ran and I love the Pave America, but\nhe didn't ran circles around him.\n>> Yeah. I I\n>> He just would have\n>> I don't I don't know. I I I guess what\nI'm saying is like I Hollywood's late to\nrecognize like what the youth was doing,\nbut back in the day there wasn't an\nopportunity to stream and do [ __ ]\nonline. So all these young talented\npeople would gravitate towards TV and\ntowards movies. So they would probably\nend up being there. And I think it's in\nHollywood's best interest to really\nrecognize what all the young folks are\ndoing because that's where the eyeballs\nare. Yeah. Like if you want people to go\nsee your movies, if you want young\npeople to see your movies, you have to\nput the young people that they're\ninvested in those movies.\n>> But somebody like Kai is interested\nthough, right? Because even what Kai is\ndoing is not TV or film. He's just\nintroducing uh the the world to him.\n>> And as we're looking at him, we're like,\nman, that guy got a lot of personality.\nYeah,\n>> man. He might be good in a movie. He\nmight be good in the sitcom. that his\napproach wouldn't be the same if he had\nto come up 30 years ago and go out there\nand audition. We might not get that\nversion of Kai. Same with you. No, we we\ndon't get the we don't get raw Andrew\nSchultz if Andrew got to come out with\nslick back hair and a black leather\njacket and I want to audition as the fun\nand I you know what I'm saying? Like we\ndon't get you 100%.\n>> So I you know that the era that we're in\ncalls for\n>> authenticity.\n>> Authenticity, right? Like like that's\nnot what the era back 30 40 years did.\nYou had to be polished and clean. Like\nthat's not what the world wants no more.\nAnd that's what Democrats keep [ __ ]\nup. That's where Kla Har even now she\nwrites this great book\n>> and for her to me it's raw\n>> cuz I'm like this is Yes. Finally you\ntelling just a little bit of truth. Just\nenough truth to rattle everybody to make\neverybody take a wing and put it around\ntheir butthole. Right. Just in case you\nreally try to go [ __ ] us, right? But\nthen you do the interviews and it's not\nthat.\n>> I know.\n>> Rachel Mad, you you get pressed a little\nbit. You're like, \"No, that's not what I\nmeant.\" Like, \"No,\nno, stand on it.\" You was right when you\nsaid you couldn't have chosen Pete as a\nrunning mate.\n>> Yeah. Why did she kind of fold on that?\nThat was weird. I think because Rachel\nMatau is a part of the LGBTQ community\nand it just was a little bit of and I\ndon't know if Kamla was trying even when\nyou read the book what she's saying is\ntrue but it's not her personal feeling.\nYou understand what I'm saying? Like if\nI say hey\n>> we can't choose this guy as a running\nman cuz he's a gay he's a gay man. I'm\nalready a black woman with a Jewish\nhusband. That's tough enough. I'm just\nlooking at it from a strategy\nperspective. I'm looking at it from\nstrictly politics, right? But people\nwill say that means you're homophobic.\nNo, it doesn't. This is business. This\nain't got nothing to do with what I\npersonally think. I'm telling you,\nAmerica's not ready for this.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't think there's anything wrong\nwith that, Chris. Do you?\n>> No. And I think that's something Trump\ndoes well is he\n>> does what he has to do, explains why he\ndoes it, doesn't try to\n>> or doesn't explain\n>> or doesn't explain doesn't apologize. I\nmean, I would say\n>> I would have loved to hear Tana Hassi\nand Ezra had that conversation cuz I\nknow that they would agree agree with\nKill on that.\n>> But but just to circle back to the\nwhat's wrong with the Democrats convo, I\ndon't think it's because they haven't\nacknowledged the original sin. I mean,\nyou said they have to throw Biden under\nthe bus. Biden's already under the bus.\nYou'd have to get his body, pull it out\nof the bus, and then throw it in front\nof the bus again.\n>> You got to be a public. You got to be\npublic. No, I got to be public. Chris,\n>> to me,\n>> public public\n>> to me, and we this got brought up, I\nthink Andrew said at the very beginning\nof the show, it's the fractured nature\nof the left right now. The left is\neating itself alive.\n>> They've always done that, though.\n>> I know, but it's heightened right now.\n>> It's identity politics. Like,\n>> it's Gaza. It's identity politics and\nit's the anger of losing and feeling\nlike the people in power are trying to\nstrip you and your friends of your\nrights and your dignity. and they\ngenuinely believe but they genuinely\nbelieve that. So I understand that\nheightened sense of defensiveness is not\ngoing to lead to a more accepting\nwelcoming coalition. The problem is you\nkind of need that.\n>> You need an accepting welcoming\ncoalition. You got to bring back people\nthat left you because they felt\nostracized. You have to if you actually\nwant to win. But I think a lot of these\npeople don't want to win to what\nCharlemagne was saying. They just want\nto be right. They want to go and make a\nTik Tok video pointing fingers at\neverybody that disagrees with that they\ndisagree with so that they could get a\nbunch of comments and a bunch of likes\nand it's like all right well then you're\nnot a serious guy.\n>> Well that's always been the case. I mean\nyou had Abby Hoffman and the far far\nradical left to similar I mean I think\nwhat we're going through now the closest\nyou know analogy is the late60s early\n70s in America. Those guys hated the\nmainstream Democratic Party, right? But\nthey had a limited platform in the sense\nthat even though they made a lot of\nnoise, it only traveled so far. Now,\nsomeone can say, \"Well, you sold out to\nthe corporate Democrats or the\nmainstream Democrats and you're\nabandoning.\" And it gets amplified that\nit seems like that person is\nrepresenting a larger, you know, portion\nof the party than they probably do. But\nthen it keeps building and building and\nbuilding and you know people are going\nto have to figure out how to\n>> you know it's like if you're working on\nsomething creative you have a scene you\nlike sometimes you got to give up stuff\nyou love you know to make the entire\npiece work you know I\n>> love President Biden\n>> yes Democrats got to give him up maybe\nBill Clinton\n>> well I can I can only I can only speak\nfor myself that was a fear-based\ndecision\n>> listen you know Republicans do that\nDemocrats don't do and I saw I saw this\nand I think it's genius JD Van said,\n\"Yeah, you know, the economy isn't where\nwe need it to be. Yeah, inflation and\nall of that stuff is up, but it's the\nDemocrat's fault.\" Why didn't they ever\ndo that when they got back in the White\nHouse? Why didn't they talk about all\nthe stimulus checks that caused\ninflation? That's what I'm talking\nabout.\n>> Democrats did not do that. Biden did it.\n>> He did a ter Well, I I heard when JD\nBann did it, it resonated and it cut\nthrough. When Biden didn't\n>> Obama did it,\n>> Obama\n>> like he did it. I'm just saying when\nthey inherited the bad economy they got\nfrom Trump.\n>> But I hate the fingerpointing. I don't\nlike it when either side does it.\n>> No, you It's politics. You have to do\nit.\n>> I know. I know.\n>> Yeah. It's not like you on the football\nfield lined up with the person and you\ncan just, you know, go headtohead with\nthem. This is how you take out your\nopponent. They do a better job of\nconstantly making Democrats look like a\nproblem. Right now, government shutdown.\nWho do some people think is responsible\nfor the government shutdown? Democrats.\nWhy? Because Republicans got the bully\npull and they're saying it. And we know\nthat's not the case. They have all the\npower. They're in control of every\nsingle thing. Who's the Democrat with\nthe loudest megaphone able to say that?\nJasmine Crockett.\n>> And she not as loud as conservative\nmedia. So now what do you do? Yo, they\njust had a meeting two days ago. This is\ncrazy to me. They had a meeting, Pete\nHexf and Donald Trump with all the\ngenerals, a public meeting that we all\nwatched where they are sitting there\ntrying to get these generals to pledge\ntheir loyalty to them. And nobody thinks\nthat's strange.\n>> One person does.\n>> We read We read enough books to know\nwhat that is, right?\n>> Wait, wait, wait. What do you What do\nyou mean? Like they they are loyal to\nhim. He's the commander-in-chief.\n>> No, no, no. They should be loyal to the\nConstitution.\n>> No,\n>> they should be loyal to the United\nStates of America. No,\n>> no, you can't be loyal to a man when a\nman is telling you, I want you to go out\nthere and and wage war on your own\ncitizens. I\n>> I'm I'm sorry, Char, man. You're off on\nthis. I mean, I disagree with waging war\non your own citizens.\n>> But that's what he that's what he said.\nYeah, but but he is the\ncommander-in-chief. Like he is in\ncontrol of\n>> in a war against a foreign power.\n>> No, he is in control of the army. He is\nin control of the navy in control of the\nair force. That is his role. If we're\ntalking about the role of the president\nhere, I don't think that there's anybody\nthat would refute that. That is his job\nand that that is part of his job and\nthat is his position.\n>> But you need people that are willing to\npush back cuz what if\n>> Yeah. Yeah. What if we have an\nauthoritarian regime in the White House\nthat is saying, \"Hey, I want y'all to\nstart interfering when people are\npeacefully protesting. I want y'all to\nstart interfering at the ballot box to\nmake sure that these people can't vote.\nI want you to start removing people that\nare my political opposition from\noffice.\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah. This is\n>> At some point, a general admiral got to\nbe like, \"Whoa,\n>> those things are horrible.\" But the\ngeneral admirals do not have the\nauthority to reject the wishes of the\npresident, if I'm not mistaken. like\nthey're not Yeah, they're not an\nindependent body because if they were,\nthen you wouldn't be able to\n>> uh go to what what\n>> Well, hold on.\n>> Congress can restrict what the president\ncan do in terms of\n>> But only Congress can declare war, I\nbelieve.\n>> Exactly. And that's why we've had all\nthese conflicts,\n>> but shouldn't then by that stance only\nCongress could tell the army to start\nenforcing against US citizens on US?\n>> You're going to war against them. and\nand Trump said if basically if you don't\nwant to do what we want you to do then\nyou got to go.\n>> So when you're trying to build your own\nmilitary that is loyal to you and not\njust and not the constitution in in the\nin the in the country.\n>> Yeah.\n>> What are we building now? We now we\nGermany. Now we Soviet Union under\nStalin. Now we [ __ ] Saddam Hussein\nand Iraq. What are we doing America?\n>> My Yeah. No, I hear that. And don't get\nme wrong, I I definitely hear like the\ntotalitarian on the fat fat admirals in\ngenerals though.\n>> Yeah. I mean we we not\n>> Yeah. I don't want no fat admirals in\ngeneral. And that is that's the one\nthing Pete Hex said.\n>> One standard. It's not a men's and\nwomen's standard. It's just one\nstandard.\n>> You can't have the strongest military in\nthe world and not look the part, bro.\nYou know what I'm saying? Like no\n>> Napoleon was a little chunky.\n>> Yeah, but he wasn't fighting.\n>> These guys aren't fighting.\n>> I mean, you want them to, I guess.\n>> I don't know, man. I just think that\nthere's a lot of things that are going\non in America that are not normal. And\nif you just read a little bit, I'm not\nthe smartest person in the world. I'm\nnot the highest grade of weed in the\ndispensary, but if you just read a\nlittle bit, in light of history\nthroughout the world, you can see how\nthis can easily happen in America. And\nit's happening like nobody. They\nliterally had a meeting and nobody It's\njust like a Oh, okay.\n>> What?\n>> It's you're you're allowed to meet with\nyour generals. This is not like a\n>> No, that was this was different, man.\nYou had to go watch it. I w you got to\ngo watch it and listen to what they're\nbasically asking them to do. Like why do\nyou want to send the military into\nPortland?\n>> So here's the thing. Obviously they're\ndoing this for like political reasons.\n>> Why though? They're in power.\n>> The question that I have about this and\nI mean this genuinely\nif people feel unsafe in their cities\nand their local governments are not\ndoing about anything about that. Do you\nthink that they\nare upset at Trump doing this or do you\nthink that they're happy about it?\n>> It depends who you ask. Like, you know,\nthere's people in DC that you can talk\nto and they're like, matter of fact, you\na got to talk to the people in DC. Go\ntalk to some of the military personnel\nthat's in DC. They'll tell you, I don't\nknow what we're doing here.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Forget the forget what people are\nsaying. Go talk to them. I've spoken to\nsome of they don't know what they're\ndoing in DC. They're like, why are we\nguarding this restaurant downtown? You\nknow what I'm saying? Why do we need to\ngo in going to Portland? Like,\n>> no. I I I hear that\n>> they're going and Mandani wins.\n>> Yeah.\n>> No, I think the be marching up and down\nthe streets.\n>> I think the opposite. I think that if\nMandani wins, Trump is going to hope\nthat the city burns so that he can use\nit as a political\n>> No, no, no, no. I agree with you. But\nthere's going to be some strategic\nchaos.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.\n>> He already said, \"I'm cutting the\nfederal budget in New York,\n>> which is horrible.\n>> They're going to they're going to put\nthe military here.\" You wasn't here last\nweek when the Secret Service was uh\nstopping everybody and making you get\nout your car and putting the gun and\nputting the dogs and Oh, cuz you know\nwhere we're at at the radio station.\nThat's right there where the UN meeting\nwas at. Oh, because the UN was\n>> Oh, that [ __ ] was crazy.\n>> Oh, that it was it was I mean it was the\nthe weirdest thing about that though,\nSecret Service, y'all never search us.\n>> You make us get out the car\n>> and you run the dogs and everything and\nyou go into the hood and you go into\nTrump, but you don't search us the\npeople. Like,\n>> that is weird.\n>> I thought that was strange. I don't know\nif it was, you know, I mean, of course,\nthere was a couple that's like, \"Oh,\nCharlamagne, what's up?\" So, maybe it\nwas me. I don't know. But I just thought\nit was weird that I don't even get at\nleast get a pat down. You're not going\nto let the dog sniff my butt, my balls,\nand you know what I'm saying? I just\nthought that was a little That's a\nlittle strange. That is a little weird.\n>> It's a little strange cuz if I went\nthrough the Secret Service checkpoint a\ncouple of times, I'm like, \"Oh, they\njust searching the car.\" So, I just keep\nwhatever I got on you. That's what I\nwould be thinking if I was\n>> 100%\n>> a criminal. You know, but\n>> I don't know, man. I just think it's\nsome strange times, bro.\n>> I don't know.

So, we'll see you October 11th.\nSalute to Jake Paul, too, man. I don't\nthink Jake Paul gets enough credit for\n>> for knowing how to finesse a bag.\n>> Yes. But the he those MVP fights are\nreally good. I went to uh\n>> Serrano and um Taylor at the Garden that\nwas it was it was a very it was just a\nvery well put together event. That [ __ ]\nwas dope. It was exciting. Like I'm a\nguy that goes to a lot of boxing\nmatches. We go to boxing matches at the\nGarden before. Outside of the fights,\nthere's nothing really entertaining\nabout the environment and the\natmosphere. He creates an environment\nand an atmosphere that just feels\nelectric soon as you walk in. Really?\nYes. I mean, come on, man. Yo, Jake\ndoesn't get enough credit, bro.\n>> Jake does not get enough credit, bro.\n>> Let's be honest. Jake Paul did a card of\nall women boxing and it was exciting.\n>> Yeah. And like where are all these like\nwoke outlets that are why aren't they\nsaying look at this guy who is\nchampioning women in a sport that for\nmost part nobody really gave a [ __ ]\nabout women\n>> paydays biggest payday their biggest\naudiences\n>> put them on Netflix would not be doing\n[ __ ] like that if it wasn't for Jake\nPaul like where is his credit\n>> listen I\n>> we only give credit to certain people\n>> n I meant I meant I meant to uh salute\nhim after I came back from the fight but\nI just just was reminded of it when I\nsaw the most valuable promotions he does\na phenomenal job with MVP, bro. Like,\nyou got to give Jake a lot of credit. I\nhope that Jake continues to be able to\nput together these type of stellar\nfights. And the thing I liked about the\nwomen card, he was he didn't have to be\ninvolved in it.\n>> Yeah. He wasn't fighting on it at all.\nNow, what I would love to see him do,\nand I'm pretty sure it might be like\nthis on the tank card, just to make sure\nthose undercard fights are great.\n>> Yeah. Make make them entertain. This is\nwhat boxing always [ __ ] up. And it's\nlike because you got to pay the main\nevent so much, there's no money for\nanybody else. But like, you know, throw\na few dollars at the next like three\nfights so that we have something really\nengaging to watch for, you know, two\nhours.\n>> Her if if if if Turkey and Jake Paul\never come together to do some type of\nboxing event cuz that's going to be the\nnext thing, right? The next thing isn't\ngoing to be just the Jake Paul Tank is\nthe main event. It's going to be the\nJake Paul and Tank, but then it might\nbe, you know, Canelo and Benvida like\nreal fight. You know what I'm saying?\nI'm not saying that Tank and Jake Jake\nPaul's not a real fight, but like actual\nboxers versus boxers. Like it's going to\nbe a thing where it's going to be like a\ncombination of of everything cuz you\nknow I I I don't think like Jake Paul\nwould have to like really go on a real\nrun of knocking out a bunch of different\nboxes that ever really get taken serious\nas a boxer.\n>> I think he's serious now.\n>> I think he's more I think he's still\nmore of a spectacle.\n>> No, no, it is spectacle\nwithout a doubt. But boxing at its\nhighest has always been spectacle,\nright? It's like one of the biggest\nfights ever is Floyd versus Conor\nMcGregor, you know. So, it's like but\nbut I think he's taken serious in that\nyou can't just be someone who's never\nlike you have even boxers\n>> like because of the weight advantage. I\ndon't love the tank fight because of the\nweight advantage personally and also the\nbig gloves. So, I think they were\nwearing 12 oz gloves. I think maybe they\nbrought it back down to 10 but like\n>> Paul Jake Paul Canelo would have been\ngood. that to me\n>> cuz to me it's like okay Jake now you\nreally\n>> and also Canelo just lost yourself so\nnow we believe that it might be\npossible.\n>> Yeah. I um No, I mean listen it's it's\nit's it's interesting. I just wanted to\nsalute to Jake. Salute the MVP. Uh let's\npay some Oh yo, Mayor Adams, you know\nMayor Adams did to us what he did to\ny'all on flagrant.\n>> What do you do?\n>> Remember when he came on flagrant and\n>> he said I'm definitely running\n>> as a Democrat. Next day\n>> he he told you I'm definitely running as\na Democrat. I'm not going to be\nindependent. But he next day he became\nindependent. He did the exact same thing\nto our show. breakfast club on a\nThursday. The first question out the\ngate, everybody says you dropping out\nthe race, Mayor Adams, what's up? I\nasked him that question about five or\nsix different ways.\n>> What did he say?\n>> He was like, \"My answer is going to be\nthe same every time. We're staying in\nthis race.\" Blah, blah, blah. Three days\nlater on a Sunday, he drops out the\ngoddamn race.\n>> What they promise him?\n>> He's hosting He's hosting the comedy\nfestival. What are you talking about?\n>> No, for real. They going to be\nambassador to Saudi Arabia.\nYou might be the promoter in this comedy\nfestival.\n>> He's going to have a hookah lounge over\nthere.\n>> That's racist. Yo,\n>> is it?\n>> That's racist.\n>> I think it is actually.\n>> That's racist.\n>> Yo, Stillwell said I saw I saw Stillwell\non the news yesterday. Stillwell said\nthe next billionaire that calls him,\nhe's recording the call.\n>> Who's Stillwell?\n>> Curtis Stillwell, the guy. He's the\nguardian angel, right?\n>> Oh, Stillwell.\n>> Stillwell. What? I said\n>> Rya Stillwell. What's his name?\n>> Curtis. Curtiswell. Curtis Slewell said\nthe next billionaire that calls him and\noffers him millions to drop out. He's\nrecording the call. Yeah.\n>> He said they're offering him millions.\n>> That's the thing. You can't do that.\nHe's a principal guy. Like this this is\na different dude. So like you're better\noff not trying to bribe him, you know?\nYou're better off not trying to bribe\nhim. I don't think Cuomo can do it, man.\n>> I don't think Cuomo can do it.\n>> You don't think you can beat Madani? No,\nbecause he's not offering anything.\n>> Like\n>> stability would be the argument.\n>> Yeah, but like to whom? Like Chris, I\ndon't know if you rent in the city. Do\nyou rent in the city?\n>> I do.\n>> Okay. Do you have rent control?\n>> No.\n>> They said Montani can't freeze the rent.\n>> No. No. Well, I think he can do a\nfreeze. I don't think that he can do\nlike a temporary freeze, but like it\ndoesn't matter. The cost of living and\nI'm someone who has money.\n>> Yeah. It's outrageous.\n>> The cost of living in this city is\n[ __ ] unbelievable. I think about it\nevery day. Trust me,\n>> bro. I I'm literally And I was talking\nto a friend of mine, but because like if\nyou have like a family, like you need\nlike three bedrooms or something like\nthat.\n>> You can't go anywhere. You can't move,\n>> bro. It's\n>> there's no\npossibilities for anything. It's just\n>> dude, you're stuck.\n>> And here's the thing, especially if it's\nlike if we're talking about three or\nfour bedrooms or something like that,\nright?\n>> Forget about it.\n>> During co Yeah. Anybody who had money\nbought a place because the loans were at\n2% the mortgage rates, right? So, you're\ngetting a place for free,\n>> right?\n>> Okay. You're basically getting a place\nfor free.\n>> That [ __ ] up.\n>> Yeah, we all [ __ ] up, right? Cuz we\ndidn't know what the hell was happening\nin the world. So, you get this 2% loan.\nSo, all these people got these 2% loans\nand they're doing interest only. So,\nthey're probably like seven years or 10\nyear interest only loans, right? So,\nthey're just sitting on all these\nproperties. And that's one reason why\nthere's no liquidity in the market is\nbecause people are sitting on these\nproperties. That's why the rental market\nis so crazy is because they have a loan\nthat is free basically for them to live.\nBut come 2027 or 28, all these mortgages\nare going to go from 2% to [ __ ] 6%\nand you're to see somebody's carry go\nfrom 100,000\n>> because they were all adjustable. They\nthey had ARMS.\n>> They have they have they have IO's,\nright? They have insurance only, right?\nLike so it's not like a 30-year ARM.\nWhat they do is they just pay the uh\nRight.\n>> Yeah. interest interest only.\n>> I mean, that that was the the thing in\nNew York was always you buy a studio and\nthen you start to outgrow it and the\nvalue goes up, let's say 5%\nhypothetically, then you buy the one\nbedroom with the difference that you've\nmade and then you just keep going up the\nladder.\n>> There's a tax loophole\n>> instead of just going to Jersey to buy a\n[ __ ] house.\n>> Can't go to Jersey right now.\n>> Yeah, you should have went years ago.\nY'all was here.\n>> Real estate is outrageous everywhere.\nThere's nowhere in the country right\nnow, but New York is like ground zero\nfor it.\n>> No, I'm with you. Hey, it's it's funny\nwhen people tell you how much your house\nis worth now cuz it's just like, well,\nwho can buy it?\n>> Who can buy it?\n>> Okay, but on the flip\n>> buy it.\n>> They they've built I saw I forget how\nmany years it was. Let's say two years.\nThey've built 12,000 new units in\nBrooklyn alone, right? You would think\nat a certain point there would be so\nmuch new supply that the prices would\ncome down. They're still going up. So,\nwho's buying these things? rich people\nin hopes that rich people in rich people\nare buying them in bulk in hopes that,\nyou know, people come and buy them and\nrent them out because there's no way\nthat regular everyday people that are,\nyou know, making,\n>> you know, workingass wages are buying\nthem [ __ ] apartments in Brooklyn.\nThere's no way, bro, when I\n>> I I don't know where people live. I\ndon't know how they live. I don't know\n>> who can afford it. Like, how many people\ncan afford it? That's We have what 8\nmillion people in this city. How is\neverybody a millionaire?\nI think a lot of it's coming\ninternationally.\n>> I\nneed we need these festivals.\n>> We need them.\n>> Saudi Arabia. I wrap this thing up with\nsome asking idiots and couple other news\nstories. The Kardashians are um suing\nRay J for defamation.\n>> Whoa.\n>> Yeah, the Kardashians are suing Ray for\ndefamation. You\n>> can't bite the hand that feeds you.\nWell, the reason I brought it up is\nbecause um you know uh last week uh Ray\nJ said that he was working with Let me\nread the headline. Yeah. Kim Kardashian\nand Chris Jenner sue Ray J for\ndefamation accused him of reckless\ndisregard for the truth. Uh oh, here.\nYeah. Um yes. Alex Spiro, the attorney\nfor Kardashian and Jenna tell people in\na statement that Ray J's allegations\nleft him no choice but to file a\nlawsuit. And the allegation was Ray J\nregarding claims he made about them\nallegedly being under investigation for\nracketeering.\nNow let me tell you the difference\nbetween radio, television, podcasting,\nstreaming, and everything else. Ray J\nsaid this I believe on I think he\nalluded to it on the TMZ. Yeah, TMZ's 2\ndocumentary, United States versus Shawn\nKols. And go back go back to that,\nChris. You had I had the line right\nthere. He said, \"If you told me the\nKardashians was being charged with\nracketeering, I might believe it.\"\nThat's what he said. And then I think\nthere was another uh scream that came\nout lately where he said he was working\nwith um the FBI on a Rico against the\nKardashians. Listen, I don't know what's\ntrue and what's not true. I just know\nthat when you say things, you got to\nprove it.\n>> Mhm.\n>> You can't just be talking nowadays. And\nI don't know why people don't realize\nthat yet. That is why I love growing up\nin the radio world because of FCC rules\nand regulations. I know that I can't\njust be saying things. We reported that\nstory last week and got a legal letter.\n>> Whoa.\n>> From Alex Brow. We report We All we did\nwas report what Ray J was alleging.\n>> Oh wow.\n>> No sides taking, no nothing. We just\nreported it. Right. I actually said\nduring the report, \"Yo, we got to stop\nthrowing the word Rico around so\nloosely. Everything can't be labeled a\nRico cuz that's what they do now.\nEverything, oh that's a Rico, that's a\nRico. Everything can't be a RICO. And we\ngot a legal letter basically saying like\nthis isn't true. And we're the Breakfast\nClub. We're not supposed to amplify\nthat. So you can be, you know, a\nYouTuber, you know, a podcaster\nand say these things and you may get\naway get away with it for a while until\nsomebody gets on your [ __ ]\nbumper or you get on the person's radar\nand they be like, \"Oh, oh yeah, let's\nsue him.\" You see what's happening with\nCandace Owens?\n>> What's happening,\n>> boy? She got sued by the people in\nFrance, right?\n>> Are they following through with that?\n>> Hell yeah, they following through with\nthat, right? We And you've heard stories\nof podcasters. Cardi B got awarded four\nmillion a YouTuber $4 million, you know,\nbecause of defamation. So my point is,\n>> man, you this is the difference between\nbeing a radio personality and just one\nof these people with\n>> talking on the internet,\n>> a platform, talking on the internet or\ntalking on the podcast who don't\nunderstand the rules and regulations. By\nthe way, this [ __ ] can still happen to\nus.\n>> You know what I mean? But it it probably\nis more than likely to happen to us\nbecause of\n>> the magnitude of the show. But nowadays,\nbecause you got people who are like a\nRay J, who's a celebrity, who when they\nsay something, that [ __ ] really, really\ntravels.\n>> You're going to end up in situations\nlike this.\n>> Wow.\n>> And so now you got to fight the\nKardashians in a defamation lawsuit. Now\nyou got to hire an attorney.\n>> You know what I'm saying? And maybe he\nhe does have some proof of what he's\nalleging. I don't know. I'm just simply\nsaying if you're going to make a I guess\nit let me say what I'm saying. If you're\na RA and you're gonna make an allegation\nlike that, you got to come with it.\n>> You can't flirt with it. This ain't no\njab, jab, jab, jab, jab. You got to go.\nYou got to come like, \"Hey, I'm doing X,\nY, and Z, and these are the reasons\nwhy.\" You can't even wait on it.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Cuz they didn't wait.\n>> Yeah.\n>> They let Ray J say what he said. They\nlike, \"Yo, we not waiting on nothing.\"\nBomb them.\n>> Wow.\n>> Bomb them.\n>> Maybe they're doing that to send a\nmessage, too. Like to anybody else who\ntries. I mean you I mean sometimes you\ngot to do that if people are making you\nknow those kind of allegations. Here's\nthe thing. Some people got time\n>> and some people got a whole lot of money\nto spend.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know most of the time it just comes\ndown to time. It's like yo you really\nwant to sue this person for some [ __ ]\nthat's not impacting you in no way,\nshape or form.\n>> But what's happening now is that a lot\nof these things are impacting folks.\n>> There's actual real world consequences\nfor these rumors that people are just,\nyou know, throwing out there. Because to\nthe point we were making earlier about\nthings being so fragmented, folks just\nnever know. You hear something online,\nyou don't know if it's real or not.\nWell, damn, I I heard this online about\nsaid individual. I don't know if it's if\nit's true or not. Maybe we should just\njust stay away or, you know, maybe just\njust wait and see what that is, right?\n>> You understand what I'm saying?\n>> 100%.\n>> Yeah. So, I get why they would do it.\n>> Interesting.\n>> I get why they would do it because you\ncould say anything nowadays. Let's do\nsome asking idiots, man.\n>> Let's do it. Let me get the pl out of\nhere. Uh, I'm really happy to see you,\nman.\n>> Man, I'm happy to see\n>> I'm not even joking, bro. I really,\nreally missed you. I\n>> missed you, bro.\n>> I'm not even telling me. This is great\nto hear. I love you,\nman, man. It was so much good [ __ ] going\non.\n>> Oh my god. D, it's cool to talk about it\nwith other people, but it's different\nwith us. It's a different energy, man.\n>> I know. It's a lot of [ __ ]\n>> A lot of [ __ ]\n>> A lot. We didn't even scratch the\nsurface. Like, I feel like there's still\na lot that happens.\n>> No, it is. It is. But I mean, we here we\n>> Yeah. Yeah. We'll get it back.\n>> Uh Jojo Biscera says, \"How does a blind\nperson know when to stop wiping after\ntaking a shit?\" Fantastic question.\n>> I thought this about um cuz it happened\nonce like I I walked I was at I was at a\ncomedy show and I walked into the\nbathroom. It was one of those lights\nthat goes off with uh motion.\n>> Oh man.\n>> And I walked in and the second I walked\nin the light came on and I just heard\nsomeone from the stall go, \"Thank God.\nCuz\ncuz they must have been in there\n[ __ ] and then have no clue\nhow no clue when they were done wiping.\n>> Bro, that is the worst feeling in the\nworld. We got one of them [ __ ] at\niheart. Bro, I ain't going to say what\nfloor it's on. I be thinking that the\nwoman at the desk be [ __ ] with me.\n>> Why?\n>> Cuz this [ __ ] just started happening.\nI've been going I've been working there\nfor 15 years and now all of a sudden\nthat [ __ ] cuts off. And when you want in\nthe toilet, you be doing [ __ ] like\ncuz you don't want to stand up.\nI did a Bobby Smur one time. Drew my\n[ __ ] hat off. You know what I'm\nsaying? Like turn the [ __ ] lights on,\nman. Like, yo, that [ __ ] is impossible\nto do, bro. How does a blind person know\nwhen to stop wiping after taking a [ __ ]\n>> I don't know, Jojo. That is one of the\nthings that we never talk about with\nblind people that is probably\nexcruciating for them. Yo.\n>> Yeah. Because they got to go extra just\nto make sure. So, they're probably\nbloody.\n>> I need one of our blind brain listeners\n>> to explain that to me cuz I really don't\nknow. And that motion light in the\nbathroom is what really makes me not I\ndon't know what y'all do. Yo,\n>> he said, \"Thank God.\nMan, when you in a public restroom, you\ngot to really watch what you say. Yo, I\nwalked into the movie theater bathroom\nat the AMC to go take a piss, and there\nwas a guy in there taking a [ __ ] And\nwhen I walked in to pee, I wasn't\ntalking to nothing. I just walked in and\nI'm peeing, and all of a sudden, I just\nhear a dude on the toilet go,\n>> George.\nHow do you recognize that stream? You\nrecognize that stream.\nAnd I'm just sitting there like what a\nstrange thing to say while you [ __ ]\nAnd I didn't answer. I was like, I\nrefuse to answer. I refused to be like,\n\"It's not George.\" I didn't want no\n>> Jesus Christ. Uh, Geomad X says, \"Is\ncomedy something that can be taught and\nlearned or you have to be born with it?\"\n>> Oo,\nI think joke writing you can learn and\nlike but I think like just being\nnaturally funny is something that you\nhave it's not you're born with, but like\nyou're you just learn through life.\n>> Is natural funny comedy though?\n>> Uh, no. It's not standup, but it is like\n>> if you're naturally funny, you can you\ncan you can do stand up.\n>> You can turn it into comedy.\n>> Can turn it in. Yeah. But there are\npeople who are not naturally funny that\ncan learn how to like write jokes.\nThere's like a math equation with jokes.\n>> I feel like comedy is a business.\n>> Ooh.\n>> It's No. Yeah. Comedy is a business and\nit's a skill set. So, it's kind of like\nuh being a street fighter if you're\nnaturally funny,\n>> but then turning that street fighting\ninto actual boxing, MMA. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. That's great.\n>> How about this? Cuz I was\n>> thinking about this myself the other\nday. Is being funny a sign of\nintelligence?\n>> Hell yeah.\n>> I think with some people\n>> I think with some people I think there's\nsome people that are dumb and that's\nwhat makes them funny.\n>> I don't think you can be funny if you're\ntruly dumb.\n>> It depends because some people aren't\ntrying to be funny, but they're funny.\nThey're just dumb. The most a lot of the\ncomedians that I really enjoy are some\nof the most intellectual\ncomedians they tend to be. I think\n>> Chris Rock. Yeah.\n>> George Carlin shows the Dave Chappelle.\nLike these guys are when you even just\nsit in convers when you just sit down\nand have a conversation with Marlon Ways\nare Kevin Hart. That's why they give the\nbest interviews.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Like they're just very smart. Like\nthey're just they are actually smart.\nAnd I think that they have a a level of\nintelligence that a lot of politicians\nwish to have\n>> because it is an intelligence that taps\ninto society.\n>> Yes.\n>> Societal intelligence. Yes.\n>> Social and emotional intelligence\n>> to observe to observe people to know\nwhat people are feeling, know what\npeople are going through. Like\n>> that's different to me.\n>> So yeah. Um King_D71.\nOo. Did y'all like Marvel Zombies? I\nthought it was dope. It was incredible.\n>> I didn't watch it. What? What is Marvel\nZombies? What is that?\n>> It's a new cartoon on uh\nIt's on Disney Plus.\n>> Oh,\n>> it's only four episodes. Oh, I thought\nit was incredible. Especially that last\nepisode [ __ ] um\n>> Who is it?\n>> Bloody ending everybody. It's I mean,\nnot everybody, but like a lot of\ndifferent superheroes. It's just like\nIt's like the zombie apocalypse and some\nof the superheroes turn into zombies.\nOh, it's fan fucktantastic.\n>> Oh, wow.\n>> It's one of them things like get high.\nLike I watched it. I was on an edible\nFriday night and that [ __ ] was\noverstimulating me. It was just like,\n\"Oh shit.\" Like, cuz the graphics and\nthe way it's animated, but then the\nstoryline like that [ __ ] was Yes, I\nenjoyed Marvel Zombies a whole lot. King\nD71. I don't know what happened at the\nend, though. I would like to know what\nhappened at the end. Like, I would I\nwant to know if um I don't want to give\nit away, but you know what I'm talking\nabout with Kamala Kamala. I want to know\nwhat what happened. Was that Was that\nthe real world or was was that all an\nillusion? I don't know. I don't know.\nUm, underscore taps says, \"Who would you\nrather have for president now?\"\n2016 Bernie or John Stewart?\n>> Whoa. Do you mean run for president?\n>> No. Have\n>> Who do we rather have right now?\n>> Um,\nJohn.\n>> I'm going John, too.\n>> Bernie.\n>> Yeah, this is no like insult. I love\nJohn Stewart, but\n>> I Yeah, I think John I think John\nbecause\nI think John because I think John might\nbe\na little bit more centrist than Bernie\nin terms of uh like Bernie Bernie I love\nBernie for this reason but he is kind of\nradical on certain things\n>> but he's also a bit of a known quantity\nwhere I my only concern with John\nStewart is how much are we projecting\nonto Yeah,\n>> that we would\n>> want I I think John Store would look at\nthis and probably say 2016 Bernie. Yeah,\nI don't know.\n>> He would definitely call for Bernie, but\nyou know, sometimes you look at people\nand you see something in them that they\nmay not see in themselves. I don't care\nwhat nobody say. John Stewart should be\nin somebody's office. John Stewart\nshould be governor of New Jersey or\nsomething. [ __ ] run for something.\nYo, John Stewart is\n>> cuz his ideas are so big, you know, the\nway he's able to communicate with\npeople, the way he's able to build\nbridges. We've seen him actually get\nlegislation passed with his words.\n>> You know what I'm saying? Actually go\nout there and put pressure on on on them\nto do the right thing to to pass this\nlegislation for the firefighters of 911\nwith his words. Like\n>> I I listen I like Bernie too. You know\nwhat though? I would probably pick\nBernie just to just to just the\n>> cuz cuz I'm this question is kind of\nconfusing because you're saying who\nwould you rather have for president\nright now? If I wanted for president\nright now it would be 216 Bernie. If you\nask me who would I want to compete to\nwin in 2028, granted we have a free and\nfair election, it would be John Stewart,\n>> you know. So, this question is a little\ntricky. Uh, let's let's do two more,\nman. What else we got? Charlie Boxiano,\nhow long before they have an AI\npresident?\n>> They have one the last uh ministry,\nright?\nI mean,\n>> maybe\n>> if he was AI, wouldn't they have him\ntalk a little cleaner?\n>> That's a good point.\n>> Sp him up a little bit.\n>> I don't think we'll ever have an AI\npresident, but I think AI will play a\nmassive role in like decision-m. So, it\nmight not be like the president, but if\nit's curating the ideas of the\npresident, is it not the president?\n>> I think we'll have an AI human hybrid\npresident at some point in life, you\nknow, cuz that's right around the\ncorner, whether y'all realize or not. I\nkeep telling y'all read this book, man.\nTechnofudalism. How technofudalism\nkilled capitalism.\n>> No, it's a book.\n>> I mean, sorry. You have you've read it?\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think\nthat, you know, a lot of this stuff is,\nyou know,\nin in more it's more in the in the near\nfuture than it is, you know, far away.\nLike, you know, there's going to be the\nneural links in people's brains. Like,\nyou know, it's going to be the people\nwho are like even now they got the\nglasses right now that you can put on\nand freaking me and you could be\ndebating and I could just be\nrolling off facts and a teleprompter in\nmy glasses, right? Like it's like a\n>> a lot of this stuff is right there and\nand and Duval asked this question a\nwhile ago and it's true. Like\n>> would you get it to compete?\n>> Cuz if you got to go out here with all\nof these [ __ ] comics that got\nNeuralink and all of this [ __ ] like that\nand\n>> like what do you do? What do you do as\nan author Chris when these [ __ ]\nis out here with the Neuralink [ __ ] in\ntheir mind and they writing? Well, it\ncomes back to the comedy question,\nright? Can AI duplicate comedy?\n>> No.\n>> No, not yet.\n>> It can't write jokes.\n>> But eventually we'll be able to\n>> the kind of like cat scale twoliner math\nequation types you're talking about.\n>> We'll be able to do those.\n>> Let's ask Chad. Give me a joke. Give me\nsomething. Give me a premise.\n>> Um, give me a premise. Let's ask Chad\nGPT.\nUh, ask GBT to write a joke about AI\ntaking over the world.\n>> Okay, let's see. Write a joke about AI\ntaking over the world\nand having access\nto male booty holes\neverywhere. Hold on. Let's give it a\nlittle razzledazzle.\nLet's see what it says.\nOkay. Jesus Christ.\nThis [ __ ] say, \"Okay, here's one in that\nWild Charlemagne style lane.\"\n>> Yeah. No, it was you. Oh, yeah. You can\nask him to write the joke in different\nways.\n>> All I said was write a joke about AI\ntaking over the world and having access\nto mail booty holes everywhere.\n>> Yeah, but it knows you. It knows.\n>> Everybody's scared about AI taking over\nthe world, man. Y'all worried about the\nwrong thing. Forget robots stealing your\njobs. Wait till chat GPT gets Wi-Fi\naccess to your booty hole history. Alexa\nalready listening to your conversations.\nNext thing you know, Siri going to be\nlike, \"Based on your last three\nsearches, you might want to stretch\nfirst.\"\n>> Yo, that's pretty good. That's That's\nThat's\ngot donkey of the day written all over\nit.\nMy god. What? Then it says, \"Want me to\npunch it up into a full Donkey of the\nDay style bit with a moral at the end?\"\nIs this your first time using chat GBT?\n>> No, but god damn.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You think his nose is me?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, I got to erase my search history\nthen.\n>> I'll be asking this [ __ ] some wild [ __ ]\nWhat the [ __ ]\nI'll be asking Chat GPT some wild [ __ ]\nbro. God damn. Let me tell chat this not\nme. Hey, I just want you to know\n>> this is not Charlemagne the God.\n>> This is not Charlemagne\nthe God. Let me see what it says.\n>> Got you. Oh [ __ ] Got you. Appreciate\nyou saying that.\n>> I know you're you and I'll keep it\nstraight with no mixups. Want me to run\nback another version of that AI takeover\njoke? Just regular standup style without\nthe Charlemagne spin.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yes.\nCharlamine using chat GBT for the first\ntime is amazing.\n>> Yes, please. Cool. Here's clean standup\nstyle take. People keep saying AI is\ngoing to take over the world. Honestly,\nI'm not scared of robots controlling the\nnukes. I'm scared of them controlling\nthe Wi-Fi. Imagine an AI with access to\neverybody's search history and uh\npersonal booty hole data. That's not\nworld domination. That's just world\nhumil humiliation. We won't be fighting\nSkynet. We'll be fighting Shameet.\nYeah, it's not there yet.\n>> It's not as far away as I'd hoped.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. No, it will be there.\n>> That is That is opener at Carolin. I've\nseen those.\n>> By the way, those are my favorites,\nthough. But those are ones that don't\nones that don't hit. And I'm just\nlaughing and everybody's like, \"What the\n[ __ ] does he think is so funny?\" There's\nnothing like watching a comedian tell a\njoke that lands, doesn't hit, and they\njust got to scramble for what's next.\nOh, especially when they don't have no\nimprov skills.\n>> Every time I see someone bomb, I think\nabout you\n>> and the joy that you'd be getting if you\nwere watching it.\n>> One more, Chris.\nThis is a good one. We We can end with\nthis one.\n>> Oh, this We've been talking about this\nall podcast kind of. They asked me what\nuh I'll scroll back up, Chris. What\nstory do you hate that you two couldn't\ntalk about together while Andrew was in\nAustralia? I mean, there was a bunch of\nthem. [ __ ] [ __ ] The president called\nme out [ __ ] the Charlie [ __ ] Like it\nwas a bunch of [ __ ]\n>> The president calling you out was crazy.\n>> I really wish I was here for that Dame\nweek, man. That week just seems so fun.\n>> It was It was I mean it was it was fun.\nIt was fun. It was fun. You know what I\nmean? It's just everything and I'm not\nsaying everything after the fact is not\nfun. It's just not serious.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know what I'm saying? And and it\nshouldn't be taken that serious. It's\njust like\n>> as serious as he's acting like it is,\nit's really not that serious, guys.\nLike, and you know, just to watch\neverybody Damon Dash is suing the\nBreakfast Club. No, he's not. No lawsuit\nhas been presented. I'm waiting on the\nchat GPT signed by him to come through.\nI haven't seen it yet, guys. All right.\nI don't know what to [ __ ] tell you.\nAll right. Scroll this way. I want to do\nthis one. This one right here. The\nnostalgia one. I like the nostalgia one\nbecause this is interesting. What\nhappens when nostalgia doesn't work\nanymore?\n>> We're getting close.\n>> I hope that doesn't happen till after\nthis Street Fighter movie comes out\n>> cuz you need nostalgia to sell the\nmovie.\n>> We need a little nostalgia.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> What do you mean when you say it's\ngetting close, Chris?\nBecause I think this is like the first\ngeneration that isn't fully creating\ntheir own material that then they'll be\nable to look back on in 20 years. 20\nyears is generally the cycle for\nnostalgia, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's kind of like sampling, right?\nLike when hip-hop I think I've said this\nbefore in the show, but when hip-hop\nstarted, it was great. They were\nsampling 50 years worth of material.\nThen at a certain point, you run out of\nsamples, right? But you haven't also\nbeen learning how to play the guitar and\nthe bass and drum and making your own\nmusic. And I think this generation is\nkind of in a pattern of reacting to\nthings instead of creating things at the\nsame kind of\n>> cadence in the past. What's the\nnostalgia going to be in 20 years for\nthis moment?\n>> Yeah, I I I I think Chris is right. Um I\nwould say that I don't think there's a\ntime where nostalgia there's a time\nthere's never going to be a time where\nnostalgia won't work.\n>> I guess Ka would be nostalgia in 20\nyears.\n>> Yes. But but but when I say there's\nnever going to be a time where nostalgia\ndoesn't work, I think that right now you\nhave people who don't have a respect for\nhistory.\n>> You know, I don't know why when I was\ngrowing up, it felt like everything\nthere was a historical context to it.\nEverything. I don't know. I don't know\nwhy it just seems like that growing up I\nwas thinking about this the other day.\nEverything had a historical context to\nit. There was nothing I was learning.\nThere was nothing I wasn't reading that\ndidn't have a historical context. Even\nso much so that you'd be reading certain\nthings, they'd reference something from\nhistory, then you would go read about,\nyou know, said history. That's why I\nused to love, I mean, I still love the\nRyan Holiday books, the Robert Greens,\nbecause they would, you know, give us\nthese lessons, but it would always be\nrooted in historical\n>> context. And and for the moment that\nwe're in right now, there is a lot of\nhistorical context to things. Like Chris\nput me on with the thing you were saying\nabout 1960 about the shift in technology\nthat I'm like, \"Oh, that's that is true,\nright?\" like this this this can't be\nsomething new\n>> that we're experiencing. But I feel like\nwe do live in an era that doesn't have\nany respect for history or they're not\nlooking to history for things.\n>> I see that in my kids.\n>> Mhm.\n>> And I push it. I push the history\n>> and they don't want it. They're not\nbiting.\n>> They live on the surface for the most\npart because I mean I think we talked\nabout this when you were gone, Andrew.\nI got a lot of inspiration from boredom,\nfrom not having something right in front\nof me, from just sitting there and just\nlike thinking about stuff and thinking\nabout stuff and starting off one place\nand ending somewhere else.\n>> These kids aren't bored for that\n>> because they're on their phone just kind\nof like taking surface material, surface\nmaterial, surface material.\n>> And uh you know, history is a deep dive.\nNo matter where you're going in history,\nit's about you know, maybe they'll go to\na Wikipedia page,\n>> see the surface, and then back up to\nsocial media. Yeah.\n>> And they're not\n>> it's not sticking. And I'm pushing it.\nI'm promoting it.\n>> And also people don't remember what\nhappened yesterday,\n>> right?\n>> Like everybody is such a prisoner of the\nmoment. Like there's things that I'll\nsee happening. And I'm like, well,\nthat's not what he said last week or\nthat's not what that person did a year\nago. Like I can I can remember things.\nAnd it's like when you pull these things\nback from the past and then show them\nlike, no, this person has a pattern.\nLike look at this. And they're like, \"Oh\nmy god.\" I'm like, but that just\nhappened. How do y'all forget that just\nthat quick? So 5 years ago, oh, forget\nabout it. 10 years ago, please. Right.\nThat's what I'm saying. Like\n>> I got I got a phone call walking over\nhere today. My daughter called me up\nfrom college and she's like, I want to\nask you about the government shutdown.\nAnd in like the 5 seconds she said that,\nI got so excited. I'm like, \"Oh, she's\ncalling me cuz she's curious about\npolitics and what it means.\" And I was\ngoing to go into a whole thing. And then\nshe's like, \"Because I'm flying to see\nmy boyfriend this weekend and I'm\nworried if the airports aren't going to\nwork.\"\n>> Exactly. No, no, no. Yo, we forgot that\nthere was a government shutdown in\nTrump's first term.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sure. I mean, it they do. They do happen\nto be fair.\n>> That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm\nsaying. Like, but the fact that\neverybody cuz I'm reading I'm like, they\nsay this hasn't happened in 15 years.\nI'm like, did this happen in Trump's\nfirst term?\n>> Oh, it did happen, right?\n>> Maybe I'm lying. I\n>> they they happen from time to time and\nthey I mean knock on wood they always\nget resolved and\n>> but they say this is the first one in 15\nyears but I'm like didn't it happen in\nTrump's first term?\n>> Well, let me look you guess what I'm\nabout to ask.\n>> Yeah. Let me ask GPT. When was the last\ntime the government\nshut down?\nWhen was the last time the government\n>> Yeah. Uh December 20 say October 1st,\n2025. Uh, prior to that, the last\nshutdown was from December 22nd, 2018 to\nJanuary 25th, 2019. 35 days under the\nTrump administration. So, where did that\n15-year number come from?\n>> Well, this is I just criticized people\nfor going on Wikipedia, but here we are.\n2013,\ngovernment shut down.\n>> But we just But I'm saying they I don't\nknow, man. But that's what I mean. I I\nread that the last one happened 15 years\nago, but this [ __ ] happened December\n22nd, 2018.\n>> Nothing's true. Nothing's false, dude.\nThere is no truth.\n>> Well, you can get the truth here, man.\nHappy to have you back.\n>> Happy you be back, brother. Love you,\ndogs. This has been great.\n>> Good to see you, man. Um, as always, if\nyou listen to this podcast, you think\nwe're smart, you think we're\nintelligent, you think we're brilliant.\nYou're absolutely right. But if you\nthink we're just a couple idiots who\ndon't know [ __ ] you're right, too. It's\nthe Brilliant Idiot Podcast. Thank you\nfor listening.",
