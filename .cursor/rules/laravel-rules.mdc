Use Laravel’s MVC structure properly: keep controllers thin, move business logic to services.

Search in `app/Services/` for similar functionality

Check `app/Services/Modules/ModuleRegistry.php` for available services

Review existing controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/`

Consider extending existing modules instead of creating new ones

Follow established patterns and architecture

Always validate requests with Form Request classes.

Use Resource classes (API Resources) for consistent JSON responses.

Centralize common logic in Services, Traits, or Helpers instead of duplicating.

Handle errors gracefully with custom exceptions + error response format.

Always return proper HTTP status codes with messages.

Secure environment variables with .env (never hardcode secrets).

Optimize database queries: use Eloquent relationships, eager loading, pagination.

Add logging with Laravel’s logger for important actions and errors.

Write tests for controllers, services, and critical features (e.g., auth, payments, business logic).

Use queues/events for long-running tasks instead of blocking requests.

Follow Laravel coding style (PSR-12, naming conventions).
