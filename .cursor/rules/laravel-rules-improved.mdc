# 🏗️ Laravel Development Rules

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Check Existing Modules First
**ALWAYS** search for existing modules before implementing new code:
- Search in `app/Services/` for similar functionality
- Check `app/Services/Modules/ModuleRegistry.php` for available services
- Review existing controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- Consider extending existing modules instead of creating new ones
- Follow established patterns and architecture

## 📁 File Structure & Organization
- Use Laravel's MVC structure properly: keep controllers thin, move business logic to services
- Place new services in appropriate directories:
  - Core modules: `app/Services/Modules/`
  - Specialized services: `app/Services/`
  - Controllers: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Client/`
- Create `.md` documentation files in `md/` folder
- Create test files in `test/` folder

## 🔧 Code Quality & Standards
- Always validate requests with Form Request classes
- Use Resource classes (API Resources) for consistent JSON responses
- Centralize common logic in Services, Traits, or Helpers instead of duplicating
- Follow Laravel coding style (PSR-12, naming conventions)
- Use proper type hints and return types

## 🛡️ Security & Error Handling
- Secure environment variables with .env (never hardcode secrets)
- Handle errors gracefully with custom exceptions + error response format
- Always return proper HTTP status codes with messages
- Validate all inputs on both client and server
- Use Laravel's built-in security features (CSRF, XSS protection)

## ⚡ Performance & Optimization
- Optimize database queries: use Eloquent relationships, eager loading, pagination
- Use queues/events for long-running tasks instead of blocking requests
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Use database indexes appropriately

## 📊 Monitoring & Testing
- Add logging with Laravel's logger for important actions and errors
- Write tests for controllers, services, and critical features (e.g., auth, payments, business logic)
- Use meaningful log messages with context
- Monitor performance and error rates

## 🏗️ Module Integration Rules
- Register new modules in `ModuleRegistry` if they're part of the core architecture
- Use existing services as dependencies when possible:
  - `FileUploadService` for file handling
  - `OpenAIService` for AI integration
  - `AIResultService` for result persistence
  - `UnifiedProcessingService` for content processing
- Follow the established dependency patterns
- Don't create duplicate functionality

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't implement functionality directly in controllers
- Don't create standalone services without proper integration
- Don't bypass the existing modular architecture
- Don't hardcode configuration values
- Don't ignore existing error handling patterns
- Don't create duplicate services when similar ones exist
